                    <h1>Measures of Center</h1>
                    <p>Statistics provides tools to understand and summarize data. Measures of center are essential in
                        statistics because they give us a single value that represents the entire dataset. This helps in
                        making decisions, identifying trends, and comparing datasets effectively. The three most
                        commonly used
                        measures of center are the mean, median, and mode.</p>

                    <h2>Mean</h2>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Mean</h2>
                        <p>The mean, also commonly known as the "average", is the sum of all data values divided by the
                            number of
                            values. The sample mean is often denoted as \( \bar{x} \), while the population mean is
                            denoted as
                            \( \mu \). Sometimes the mathematical formulas for calculating the mean are given as shown
                            below:</p>
                        <p>\[
                            \text{Sample Mean: } \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
                            \]</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>There are several times throughout the course you may encounter formulas used to find a
                        particular statistic so we will attempt to explain some of the symbols as we progress. The
                        \(\sum \) symbol in mathematics means "add", the \( x \) symbol represents data values in the
                        sample, and \( n \) represents the number of values in the sample. So interpreting the formula
                        above for finding the sample mean \( \bar{x} \) is found by adding all the data values and
                        dividing by the number of values in the dataset.</p>
                    <p>While there are formulas for many of the statistics used to describe datasets, it is important to
                        not focus so much on the formula but to understand the meaning of the values. When trying to
                        understand the mean, it is important to keep these key concepts in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sample means drawn from the same population tend to vary less than other measures of center
                        </li>
                        <li>The mean takes every data value into consideration</li>
                        <li>If there are extreme values (outliers) in the dataset, they can impact the mean
                            substantially</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>In order to find the mean for this sample of test scores, we will just sum up all the scores
                            and then divide by the number of scores. This gives us the following \[
                            \bar{x} = \frac{75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95}{5} = 85
                            \]</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Median</h2>
                    <p>The median can be described as the "middle value" of a dataset, where approximately half of the
                        values are smaller than the median and the other half are larger. A more precise definition
                        follows.</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Median</h2>
                        <p>The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. If the dataset has an odd number of
                            values, the median is the center value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the
                            median is the average of the two center values.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>When interpreting the median it is important to keep a few important properties in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The median is not effected by extreme values in the dataset</li>
                        <li>The median does not take every data value into consideration</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>First, to find the mean, we just need to sum up all the values and divide by how many we
                            have. This will give us a mean of
                            \[ \bar{x} = \frac{1449}{20}=72.45 \] </p>
                        <p> Next we will need to order the data to find the median. This is best done with technology,
                            but we get the following order: </p>
                        <p> 20, 53, 59, 59, 63, 63, 72, 72, 72, 72, 72, 76, 78, 81, 83, 84, 84, 84, 90, 93. Since there
                            are twenty values (even number), the median
                            is the average of the two middle values: \[
                            \text{Median} = \frac{72 + 74}{2} = 73.
                            \]</p>
                        <p>Median is preferred over the mean in datasets with outliers as it is not affected by extreme
                            values, but in this particular dataset both values are very close to one another.</p>

                    <p>Each measure of center provides unique insights into a dataset, making them critical tools for
                        data analysis. Measures of center can always be calculated from a sample, but it is crucial to
                        consider if doing so is meaningful. For nominal data, which consist of names or categories,
                        calculations like the mean or median are meaningless. Additionally, the validity of these
                        statistics depends on the soundness of the sampling method; poor methods can lead to misleading
                        results.</p>
