    <h1>Experimental Design</h1>
    <p>
        Experimental design ensures reliable and unbiased results by structuring studies to isolate
        treatment effects and control variability. This section covers three key designs—completely
        randomized, randomized block, and matched pairs.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Designs</h2>
    <!-- Definition: Completely Randomized Design -->
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Completely Randomized Design?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>completely randomized design</strong> assigns treatments to subjects entirely at
            random, without grouping or blocking. This design works well when the subjects are similar
            and there are no additional variables that need to be controlled.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A clinical trial randomly assigns participants to receive one of
            three medications to treat high blood pressure. Results are compared across all
            participants.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span></h2>
        <p>Many utility companies have introduced programs to encourage energy conservation among their
            customers. A particular company has three options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a small digital display in households to show current electricity usage.</li>
            <li>Give customers a chart and information about monitoring their use from the outside
                meter.
            </li>
            <li>Use a control group that receives general information about conserving energy but no
                tools
                to monitor their use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Design a flowchart that models this experiment.</p>

                <p>The experiment can be modeled using a completely randomized design as follows.</p>
                <p>First, we have a block to represent all the individuals in the sample.<img

                    randomly sort the individuals into three groups:
                    one group for each treatment and one placebo group. We label the groups 1, 2, and 3.
                    We draw
                    an arrow from our initial block to each of the three groups, as follows.<img
                        src="../images/Completely%20Randomized%20Design%202.png"
                        alt="Groups 1, 2, and 3 are added to the flowchart."
                        title="Groups 1, 2, and 3 are added to the flowchart." width="262"
                        height="380">Next, we add a block for each treatment and one for the
                    placebo.&nbsp;
                    We assign the treatments to the groups at random.&nbsp; In the diagram, we then draw
                    an
                    arrow from the group to the treatment it receives.&nbsp; Typically, the treatment
                    block is
                    draw to the right of the group block it is assigned to, as demonstrated in the
                    following
                    image.<img src="../images/Completely%20Randomized%20Design%203.png"

                        height="380"></p>
                <p>Finally, we add a single block at the end indicating that the data is collected, and
                    the
                    results from all the treatment and placebo groups should be compared.&nbsp; In the
                    flow
                    chart, we indicate this by drawing an arrow from each treatment to the Compare
                    Results box,
                    and our flowchart is complete.<img

    <!-- Definition: Randomized Block Design -->
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Randomized Block Design?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>randomized block design</strong> groups subjects into blocks based on shared
            characteristics or variables that may influence the results. Treatments are then randomly
            assigned within each block, and comparisons are made within the blocks.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a weight loss study, participants are grouped into blocks by
            gender (e.g., male and female). Within each block, participants are randomly assigned to
            different diet plans, and results are compared separately for males and females.</p>

    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span></h2>
        <p>A cosmetics company wants to compare the effectiveness of two facial creams: Cream A, which
            claims to reduce wrinkles, and Cream B, which claims to improve skin hydration. The company
            recruits 40 participants and divides them into blocks based on skin type: oily, dry,
            combination, and sensitive. Each block contains 10 participants. Within each block,
            participants
            are randomly assigned to use either Cream A or Cream B for four weeks, and their skin
            condition
            is evaluated at the end of the study.</p>

                    types differently. We draw an arrow from the sample to each of the different skin
                    types.<img class="img-weird" src="../images/Block%20Design%202.png"
                        alt="Next, separate the groups by skin type."
                        title="Next, separate the groups by skin type.">Now, we
                    treat each block as its own SRS, and assign members in each block into one of two
                    groups, as
                    shown below.<img class="img-weird" src="../images/Block%20Design%203.png"
                        alt="Next, sort the blocks into groups."
                        title="Next, sort the blocks into groups.">Since we are treating each block as its own SRS, we'll
                    assign each group within a block one of the two creams.<img class="responsive-image"
                        src="../images/Block%20Design%204.png"

                        title="Within each block, assign the treatments to the groups.  Treat each group as its on SRS.">The whole point of the block design is to
                    account for
                    the different types of skin. So, when we get to the compare results step, we only
                    compare
                    results within each block. &nbsp;This ensures that any differences observed are due
                    to the
                    treatment and not the characteristics defining the blocks.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Definition: Matched Pairs Design -->
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Matched Pairs Design?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>matched pairs design</strong> is a special case of the randomized block design
            where subjects are paired or matched in some way. This design is used to compare two
            treatments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Pair two individuals based on shared characteristics.
                Randomly assign one individual in each pair to receive the first treatment, and the
                other to receive the second treatment. Compare results within each pair.
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Two participants of similar age and fitness level are
                    paired. One is assigned to a new exercise routine, and the other follows a standard
                    routine. Their progress is compared after four weeks.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Use the same individual for both treatments. Assign one of
                the treatments to the individual at random, and once the experiment is concluded, apply
                the other treatment at a later time under similar conditions. Compare the results for
                that individual.
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A participant tests two different types of running shoes by
                    running a set distance with each pair on different days. Their times are compared to
                    determine which shoe performs better.</p>

        <p>Researchers are studying the effect of two different dashboard layouts on driver reaction

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good experimental design minimizes bias, controls variability, and ensures valid comparisons.
        Completely randomized designs work for homogeneous groups, randomized block designs account for
        shared characteristics, and matched pairs designs allow detailed within-subject or paired
        comparisons. Proper design leads to meaningful and reliable results.</p>
