                    <h1>Types of Data and Ways of Sampling</h1>
                    <p>Understanding data begins with recognizing its classification and the processes used to collect
                        it. Data can broadly be categorized into two classifications with each providing a unique
                        insight into a population or sample allowing for a more targeted analysis of particular aspects.
                        When collecting data it is important to implement an appropriate sampling method so that the
                        data can be used to learn something about the population that it originated. This section will
                        detail data types as well as the common sampling methods used to collect that data.</p>

                    <h2>Data Classification</h2>
                    <p>Data originates from either a population or a sample and can be classified into two main
                        categories: <strong>Qualitative Data</strong> and <strong>Quantitative Data</strong>.</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Qualitative Data</h2>
                        <p>Qualitative data (or categorical data) categorizes or describes attributes of a population,
                            often using words or letters. Examples include hair color (e.g., black, brown), blood type
                            (e.g., AB+, O-), or car types(e.g., Toyota, Explorer, Jeep). This type of data is not
                            generally suited for mathematical analysis meaning that averages or standard deviations are
                            not meaningful (e.g. you wouldn't be able to average hair colors).</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Quantitative Data</h2>
                        <p>Quantitative data represents numerical values obtained by counting or measuring attributes.
                            Examples include weight, pulse rate, the number of people/objects, etc. Quantitative data is
                            further divided into two subcategories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Discrete data</b> results when the number of possible values is either a finite
                                number or a “countable” number (i.e. the number of possible values is 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
                                ). Examples might include number of phone calls: 0 calls, 1 call, 2 calls, etc.</li>
                            <li><b>Continuous data</b> results from infinitely many possible values that correspond to
                                some continuous scale that covers a range of values without gaps, interruptions, or
                                jumps. This includes almost any measurement of distance, time, volume, temperature,
                                mass, or combination of any of these. For example, weights like 2.4 grams and 7.5 pounds
                                would be continuous data since the scale they originate from has infinite divisions
                                (i.e. you could get the measurement as precise as possible). </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Levels of Measurement</h2>
                    <p>Statistics involves understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data, and a key component is determining the "level of measurement" of data. Levels of measurement are important because they determine the types of statistical analyses that can be performed and ensure proper interpretation of data. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Each builds upon the previous level, providing more information about the data.</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                      <h2 class="definition-header">Different Levels of Measurement</h2>
                      <p><b>Nominal Level:</b> Data at this level are categorized without any order. For example, trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense: putting pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful. Examples might include anything that is qualitative data where there is no inherent order that can be prescribed: gender, eye color, types of fruits, etc.</p>
                      <p><b>Ordinal Level:</b> Data are categorized with a meaningful order, but differences between categories are not measurable. Examples include rankings in a competition or survey responses such as "satisfied," "neutral," or "dissatisfied."</p>
                      <p><b>Interval Level:</b> Data have meaningful order, measurable differences, but no true zero point. Examples include temperature in Celsius or years on a calendar. Interval level data can be used in calculations, but since there is no true zero point it isn't meaningful to make a ratio. For example: 6 PM isn't twice as big as 3 PM despite there being three hours between the two times of day.</p>
                      <p><b>Ratio Level:</b> Data have a meaningful order, measurable differences, and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios. Examples include weight, height, or age.</p>

                    <h2>Sampling Techniques</h2>
                    <p>Sampling is used when gathering data from an entire population is impractical or too expensive. A
                        sample should represent the population's characteristics, and random sampling methods help
                        achieve this. Common random sampling techniques include:</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Sampling Techniques</h2>
                        <p><b>Simple Random Sampling:</b> Every individual in the population has an equal chance of
                            being selected, ensuring that all samples of the same size are equally likely.</p>
                        <p><b>Stratified Sampling:</b> Divide the population into groups (strata) and take a
                            proportionate random sample from each group. For instance, sample students from various
                            departments to represent a college population.</p>
                        <p><b>Cluster Sampling:</b> Divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some
                            clusters and include all members from those clusters in the sample. For example, randomly
                            select departments in a college and survey all their students.</p>
                        <p><b>Systematic Sampling:</b> Randomly select a starting point and pick every nth member from a
                            population list. For example, choose every 50th name in a phone book for a survey.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Non-random sampling, such as convenience sampling, selects readily available participants, which
                        can lead to biased results. An example of convenience sampling might be selecting the first 20
                        customers entering a coffee shop: this sample is not random and will likely be biased in some
                        way. Sampling errors (e.g., small sample sizes) and nonsampling errors (e.g., data entry
                        mistakes) can also affect results. Larger samples tend to reduce sampling error, but sampling
                        bias occurs if some members have unequal chances of selection.</p>

                    <p>Critical evaluation of studies is essential. Issues to consider include representativeness,
                        sample size, undue influence, causality, and potential confounding factors.</p>
