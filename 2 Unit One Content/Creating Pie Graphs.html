    <h1>Creating Pie Graphs</h1>
    A&nbsp;<strong>pie chart</strong> is statistical graph that divides a circle up into slices whose
    area is proportional to the quantity of the category that it represents.&nbsp; Pie charts are useful
    when there are a small selection of categories, and the categories represent every possible option
    under consideration.<br>
    <h2>Conditions for Using a Pie Graph</h2>
    <!--Begin Explaination Block-->
    <div class="definition">
        <h3>When can I use a Pie Graph?</h3>
        <p>A pie graph should only be used under two specific conditions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data can belong to exactly one of the categories.</li>
            <li>Categories must be parts of a whole.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, the following table summarizes the numbers of stars a particular store was rated
            during a 30-day period.</p>
        <table style="width: auto; height: 234.643px;">
            <caption style="display: table-caption; width: max-content;">Store Ratings Over a 30-Day
                Period</caption>
            <thead>
                <tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
                    <th scope="col">Star Rating</th>
                    <th scope="col">Percentage of Ratings</th>
                    <th scope="col">Number of Transactions</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
                    <td>1 Star</td>
                    <td>5%</td>
                    <td>16,468</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="height: 39.1071px;">

                    <td>8%</td>
                    <td>26,348</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>5 Stars</td>
                    <td>55%</td>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Notice that every category is included, and since each transaction can only be associated to
            exact one rating, the first condition is satisfied as well.&nbsp; This data could be made
            into a Pie Chart.</p>
    </div>
    <!--End Explaination Block-->At times, categorical data may be provided that violates one or both of
    these conditions. In some cases, it might still be possible to use a pie graph, but not always. In
    our first example, the data cannot be used to create a pie graph.&nbsp;
    <h3 class="example-header"><a href="#example1"></a></h3>
    <p>Suppose a survey asked which department(s) a customer purchased from during their last visit to a
        particular department store. Explain why a pie graph cannot be used with the following set of

    <table style="width: auto;">

    <div class="solution">
        <h4 class="solution-header">Solution</h4>
        <p>Although this data is helpful for stores to understand which departments are shopped the
            most, it is not suitable for creating a pie chart because customers may shop in multiple
            departments during a single visit. Unless the question is reframed to something like, "Which
            department was your primary reason for visiting the store today?" customers will fall into
            more than one category, violating the first condition.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this categorical overlap causes the percentages to exceed 100%, which goes against
            the pie chart's requirement that all parts must represent a complete whole.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the list of departments may not be exhaustive (e.g., common departments like
            "Health &amp; Beauty" are missing), further disqualifying this data for use in a pie chart.
        </p>
        <p>$$\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}$$</p>
    </div>
    <!-- End Solution Block-->Many examples can be resolved by simply adding an "Other" category to the
    results. This is commonly done because some responses may not fit within the predefined categories
    in a survey question. Furthermore, when several categories have relatively small percentages
    compared to the main categories, they are often grouped into an "Other" option. This approach
    highlights the primary categories and makes the overall results easier to interpret, avoiding an
    overload of less significant choices for the reader. Our next example demonstrates an appropriate
    use of adding an "Other" category.&nbsp;
    <h3 class="example-header">Example 2</h3>
    <p>A survey was conducted to determine the types of activities people prefer on weekends. A survey
        of 1,303 people were asked, "Which of the follow activities do you most prefer to do on
        weekends? Please select only one option." The percentages were tabulated and reported in the
        table below. Explain why a pie chart cannot be created from this table and suggest how it could
        be corrected.</p>

        <p>Since the survey question required respondents to select only one activity, we know that each
            person belongs to exactly one category. However, the given percentages only add up to 98%,
            which indicates that 2% of the data is missing. To fix this, we can create an "Other"
            category to account for the remaining 2%. This ensures that all respondents are included,
            and the categories represent parts of a whole. Once the missing data is accounted for, the
            conditions for creating a pie chart are satisfied.</p>
        <p>$$\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}$$</p>
    </div>
    <!-- End Solution Block-->
    <p>As a final example, it is important to recognize that some reported data may have percentages
        that add up to 100%, but the categories are not truly parts of a whole. This often confuses
        students who focus too heavily on the idea that the parts must sum to 100%, without recognizing
        that the data does not represent components of a single whole. The next example provides a
        demonstration of this type of situation.</p>
    <h3 class="example-header">Example 3</h3>
    <p>A survey asked 1,373 respondents, "What is your favorite activity while on vacation?" The
        responses are summarized in the following table. Explain why this data cannot be used to make a
        Pie Chart.</p>
    <table style="width: auto;">

                <td>35%</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Outdoor adventures (e.g., hiking or kayaking)</td>

        <p>In this case, the percentages add up to 100%, but the responses do not represent parts of a
            whole. Each response reflects a preference for a single activity while on vacation, rather
            than components of a unified whole. For example, another type of response could have been
            attending cultural events such as festivals, concerts, or other local performances.</p>
        <p>This illustrates how data that sums to 100% can still fail to meet the criteria of

        <p>First, load the data into the <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/tmu6ja9y" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Bar and Pie Chart Generator Tool</a> and note that the tool automatically
            generates a bar graph by default.&nbsp; Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Pie Graph
                Checkbox</strong>, and it switches the graph to a Pie Graph.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img src="../images/piegraph_example1a.png"
                alt="A pie graph of the satisfaction rates for a recent hospital visit."
                title="A pie graph of the satisfaction rates for a recent hospital visit." width="400"
                height="311"></p>
        <p>Since there are no units attached to our data, we can delete the text from the units
            textbox.&nbsp; We also give the pie chart a title, and our pie chart is complete.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/piegraph_example1b.png"
                alt="A title have been added to the pie graph."
