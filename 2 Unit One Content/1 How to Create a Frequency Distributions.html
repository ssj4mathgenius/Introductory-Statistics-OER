          <h1>How to Create Frequency Distributions</h1>
          <p>Distributions hold significant theoretical importance in this course. In this section, we will learn about
            frequency distributions, which is the basis for many of the concepts in this course.</p>
          <h2>Basics of Frequency Distributions</h2>

          <div class="definition">
            <h3>What is Frequency?</h3>
            <p>The <strong>frequency</strong> of a data point is how many times it shows up in the data set.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>What is a Frequency Distribution?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>frequency distribution</strong> is a table that lists either the raw data or classes (defined
              below) in the first column and corresponding frequency in the second column.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- End Definition Wrapper -->
          <p>Before the advent of computers, frequency distributions were created manually. This involved arranging the
            data in ascending order and marking a tally for each occurrence of a data point. This process was prone to
            human errors such as miscounting or duplicating data.</p>
          <p>With computers, creating frequency distributions is much faster and more accurate than manual methods.
            Tools like SPSS, MATLAB, and Excel offer advanced statistical capabilities. GeoGebra, however, is
            particularly useful in educational settings because of its simplicity and visualization tools, making it
            ideal for students learning this process.</p>
          <h3 class="example-header">Example 1</h3>
          <p>The data on the number of deaths directly caused by tornadoes in Tennessee is given in the table below.
            Create a Frequency Distribution for the number of deaths per year.<br><button

            <h5>Interpretation</h5>
            <p>The numbers in the Data column represents the number of deaths reported.&nbsp; The numbers in the
              Frequency column represent the number of years from 1950 to 2023 that reported that many deaths.&nbsp; For
              example, 10 years between 1950 and 2023 reported 10 deaths caused by Tornadoes in Tennessee.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- End Solution Wrapper -->
          <p>While Example 1 works well for small data sets, many frequency distributions group data into ranges instead
            of listing each unique data point individually. For example, we could group the number of years with 0 to 4
            deaths, 5 to 9 deaths, 10 to 14 deaths, and so on, creating a row in the table for each of these ranges.
            These ranges are called&nbsp;<strong>classes</strong> or <strong>bins</strong> in statistics.</p>
          <p>If we created a new class for every 5 deaths, we would need 16 classes to cover all the data, from the
            class with 0 to 4 deaths up to the class with 75 to 79 deaths. However, this approach would lead to many
            classes with a frequency of 0, which makes the table less meaningful. To avoid this, we want the ranges to
            be large enough to capture meaningful data but not so small that most classes are empty.</p>
          <p>So how many classes should we have? As the researcher, you get to decide, but a good rule of thumb is to
            aim for 5 to 20 classes. Once the number of classes is chosen, the formula below will help determine the
            range for each class, known as the <strong>class width</strong>.</p>
          <!-- Definition Wrapper -->
          <div class="definition">
            <h3>How do you calculate class width?</h3>
            <p>The<strong> class width</strong> is the size of each class and determines how data is grouped. It is
              calculated using the formula&nbsp; \[ \text{class width } = \dfrac{\text{largest value } - \text{smallest
              value }}{\text{number of classes}}.\]</p>
            <p>If the result is a decimal, always round up to the next whole number to ensure all data points fit into
              the intervals. For example, if the calculated width is 9.38, round it up to 10. This ensures every data
              point fits into one of the classes without gaps.</p>
            <p>If the largest data point ends up being the exact right endpoint of the last class, we add 1 to the class
              width calculation to ensure all data points fit within the classes.&nbsp; Our tool automatically checks
              for this case and you don't have to worry about it.</p>
            <h4>What does this number mean?</h4>
            <p>The class width measures the difference between the smallest numbers in successive classes.&nbsp; For
              example, if our first class is from 0 to 4 deaths and our second class is from 5 to 9 deaths, then the
              class width is 5 since \(5-0=5\).</p>
          </div>
          <p>Class widths, along with the minimum value of the data set, define what is known as <strong>boundary
              points</strong>. Boundary points define where one class ends and another class begins.</p>
          <!-- Definition Wrapper -->
          <div class="definition">
            <h3>How do I compute the Boundary Points?</h3>
            <p>The minimum value is the first boundary point. To find the other boundary points, keep adding the class
              width until you get a value that is larger than (but not equal to) the maximal value in our data set.</p>
            <p>For example, if we wanted a class width of 5 for the classes of tornado deaths, the boundary points are
              0, 5, 10, 15, 20, \(\ldots\), 70, 75, 80.</p>

              not including 10.&nbsp; The Frequency, as before, tells us the number of years whose number of deaths fell
              into that range of values.&nbsp; For example, there were 64 years that had between 0 and 10 deaths.

          <h2>Relative Frequency</h2>
          <p>An important concept related to frequency is relative frequency, and it is a foundational concept for
            several key topics in this course.&nbsp; We will use relative frequencies when discussing cumulative
            frequencies (discussed below), creating histograms, studying probability and probability distributions, and
            using statistical inference to discuss population proportions. &nbsp;By connecting data analysis to
            probability theory and statistical inference, relative frequency serves as a bridge between descriptive and
            inferential methods in a statistics course.&nbsp;</p>
          <!-- Definition Wrapper -->
          <div class="definition">
            <h3>What is Relative Frequency?</h3>
            <p><b>Relative Frequency&nbsp;</b>has two interpretations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For&nbsp;<strong>raw data</strong>, relative frequency is the percentage of times that a particular
                value appears in a data set.</li>
              <li>For <strong>data sorted into classes</strong>, relative frequency is the percentage of data that
                appear in a given class.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In both cases, the formula for relative frequency is identical: \[\text{relative frequency
              }=\dfrac{\text{frequency}}{n},\] where \(n\) is the number of data points in the sample.&nbsp; Notice that
              this will always give a percentage as a decimal, so we will always write \(0.3947\) instead of \(39.47\)%
              in this course. &nbsp;Using percentages instead of decimals can cause errors in many of the formulas
              because most statistical formulas use relative frequencies rather than percentages to ensure accurate
              calculations. &nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="warning">⚠️ Warning ⚠️</h4>
            <p>Relative frequencies will always yield a number between 0 and 1. If you get a number larger than 1 or a
              negative number, double check your work because you made a calculation error!</p>

            <h3>What is a Relative Frequency Distribution?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>relative</strong> <strong>frequency distribution</strong> is a table that lists either the raw
              data or classes in the first column and the corresponding relative frequencies in the second column.</p>

                width="400" height="238"><br>To determine the number of data points, we sum the Frequency column:
              \[64+4+1+3+1+0+0+1=73.\] Next, we choose a class, such as the interval 0 to 10, and note its frequency,
              which is 64. The relative frequency is found by dividing the class frequency by the total:
              \[\dfrac{64}{73}\approx 0.8767.\] Thus, \(0.8767\) is the relative frequency for 0 to 10, meaning
              \(87.67\%\) of the years from 1950 to 2023 had 0 to 10 deaths (excluding 10).&nbsp; Note we will always
              round relative frequency to four decimal places, which is a standard practice in statistics.</p>

          <p>While it is essential to know how to compute a relative frequency, performing multiple manual calculations

              not including 10.&nbsp; The Relative Frequency column tells us the percentage of years in which the number
              of deaths fell into that range of values.&nbsp; For example, 85.14% of the years whose total number of

          <h2>Cumulative Frequency</h2>
          <p>Another important concept related to frequency is cumulative frequency, which keeps a running total of
            frequencies up to a specific value or class.&nbsp; This provides insight into how data accumulates over a
            specific range of values, and is fundamental in understanding ideas such as median, quartiles, interquartile
            ranges, computing area under the uniform, normal, and student T curves. By synthesizing raw data into
            meaningful patterns, cumulative frequency serves as a stepping stone to deeper statistical concepts,
            emphasizing the relationship between individual data points and their overall context within a
            dataset.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>What is a Cumulative Frequency Distribution?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>cumulative</strong> <strong>frequency distribution</strong> is a table that lists either the
              raw data or classes in the first column and the corresponding cumulative frequencies in the second
              column.&nbsp;</p>

              From the frequency distribution, 32 years had 0 deaths, 10 years had 1 death, 6 years had 2 deaths, and 7
              years had 3 deaths. Adding up the number of years gives \[32+10+6+7=55,\] so the cumulative frequency for
              \(3\) is 55. Therefore, 55 years between 1950 and 2023 had 3 or fewer tornado-related deaths in
              Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>While it is good to have an idea of how to compute a cumulative frequency, the multiple manual calculations

            example, we will see how to use our GeoGebra tool to create a cumulative frequency distribution.</p>

            <p>The first thing we are going to do is uncheck the <strong>Relative Frequencies</strong> checkbox, which

              the&nbsp;<strong>Cumulative Frequencies</strong> checkbox to change the second column from Frequencies to

              death total for the year is less than or equal to the value in the Data column.&nbsp; For example, for
              \(x=17\) deaths, the cumulative frequency of 68 indicates that, between 1950 and 2023, there were 68 years
              in which the number of deaths caused by tornadoes in Tennessee was 17 or fewer.</p>

          <h2>Relative Cumulative Frequency</h2>
          <p>Relative cumulative frequency, which integrates the concepts of relative frequency and cumulative
            frequency, offers a powerful tool for understanding data distributions in a statistical context. It
            represents the percentage of data points at or below a specific value.&nbsp; When we study area under the
            normal curve later in this course, we will use both cumulative frequencies and relative cumulative
            frequencies.</p>

            <h3>What is Relative Cumulative Frequency?</h3>
            <p><b>Relative Cumulative Frequency&nbsp;</b>is the percentage of data points that are less than or equal to

              express the percentage as a decimal, such as \(0.2934\) instead of \(29.34\)%. Using percentages instead
              of decimals can cause errors in many of the formulas we will use in this course, as they require values to
              be expressed as decimals for accurate computation.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a formula, we can express this as
              \[\text{relative cumulative frequency}=\dfrac{\text{cumulative frequency}}{n},\] where \(n\) is the number

              of data points: \[\dfrac{61}{74}\approx 0.8243.\] This means that \(82.43\%\) of the years had 5 or fewer

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Understanding frequency distributions and their variations—such as relative frequency, cumulative
            frequency, and relative cumulative frequency—is essential for interpreting and analyzing data in statistics.
            Statistical tools like GeoGebra simplify the creation process, allowing us to focus on understanding the
            data rather than manually building the tables. By automating class width adjustments, boundary point
            calculations, and frequency conversions, our GeoGebra tools ensure accuracy while making it easier to
            identify trends and key patterns in data. Mastering the concepts of frequency, relative frequency, and
            cumulative frequency lays a strong foundation for tackling more advanced statistical topics later in this
            course.</p>
