                    <h1>Measures of Variation</h1>
                    <p>Measures of variation provide insights into the spread or variability within a dataset.
                        They help us understand the consistency or diversity of data values. Common measures
                        include the range, standard deviation, and variance. These measures are crucial in
                        comparing datasets and determining data reliability.</p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Range</h2>
                        <p>The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides
                            a very easy to calculate measure of variability. It is found by the formula: </p>
                        <p class="p-centered"><em>Range = Max - Min</em></p>
                        <p>While range is an easy way to gauge variance in datasets, it uses outliers in it's
                            calculation making it not as reliable as other measures of variation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Standard Deviation</h2>
                        <p>The standard deviation quantifies the average deviation of each data point from the
                            mean \( \bar{x} \). It is the most commonly used statistic to assess variability in
                            datasets. The standard deviation is commonly represented with \( s \) and is found by the
                            following formula:</p>
                        <p>\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \]</p>
                        <p>Standard deviation will have the same units as the original data. Later on in the course we
                            will reference the population standard deviation which is commonly represented by the \(
                            \sigma \) symbol (the greek letter "sigma"). </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Variance</h2>
                        <p>Variance is the square of the standard deviation and provides a measure of data
                            spread in squared units. It can be found by squaring the standard deviation. Variance for
                            the sample is represented by \(s^2\) where the population variance is represented by \(
                            \sigma^2 \).</p>

                        <p>A small bakery tracks the number of cakes sold each day over a six-day period to analyze

                            period. Use the data to find the range, standard deviation, and variance for cake sales
