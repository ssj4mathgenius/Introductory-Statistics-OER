                    <h1>Introduction to Statistics</h1>
                    <p>Statistics are widely used in everyday life, from crime and sports to education and real estate.
                        Whether reading a newspaper, watching TV, or browsing the internet, we often encounter
                        statistical information based on samples. This data helps assess the accuracy of claims to help
                        us all make better and informed decisions. Understanding statistical methods is essential for
                        analyzing information thoughtfully, whether buying a house, managing a budget, or working in
                        fields like economics, business, psychology, biology, or law. This beginning module introduces
                        the fundamentals of statistics including the mindset for being a statistics student, learning
                        the relevant definitions, explaining how data is collected, and how to identify reliable data.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Key Terms for Statistics</h2>
                    <p>Before learning about what all is involved in statistics, it is important to introduce a few key
                        words that will be used all throughout our study of statics.</p>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Data</h2>
                        <p>Data is any collections of observations (such as measurements, genders, survey responses,
                            etc.).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Examples of Data</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>An instructor asks their class how many hours they studied last week and the class
                                responded with various times ranging from 30 mins to 4 hours. All of these "times" given
                                by the students would be considered Data.</li>
                            <li>A survey online asks users to identify their favorite fast food restaurant. Two of the
                                selections made are Zaxbys and McDonald's. These two selections are considered data.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Statistics</h2>
                        <p>Statistics is the science of planning studies and experiments, obtaining data, and then
                            organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based
                            on the data.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Statistics operates by using studies, surveys, polls, and other data collection tools to gather
                        information from a subset of a larger group, allowing insights about the entire group. This
                        principle reflects the core purpose of statistics and the objective of this course:
                        understanding some larger group by analyzing data from a representative subset. This brings us
                        to the following terms used to describe the concepts involved in what we want to achieve:</p>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Population</h2>
                        <p>A population is the complete collection of all individuals (scores, people, measurements, and
                            so on) to be studied. The collection is complete in the sense that it includes all of the
                            individuals to be studied. This is the larger group intended to be studied.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Census</h2>
                        <p>A census is the collection of data from every member of the population.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example 1: Collecting a Census</h2>
                        <p>A statistics professor is studying the amount of sleep his students get each night in his
                            class of thirty students. If he is able to obtain data from all thirty students in his class
                            then he has a census.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Sample</h2>
                        <p>A sample is a subset (or smaller group) of members selected from a population.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example 2: Collecting a Sample</h2>
                        <p>If a statistics professor is studying the amount of sleep his students get each night and is
                            only able to collect data from ten of his thirty students then he has collected a sample.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>It is important in this course to distinguish between a sample and the population that the sample
                        comes from. If a Gallup poll is given to all eligible voters and there are 2.3 million
                        responses, then the sample in this scenario is the 2.3 million respondents/responses and the
                        population is all adults eligible to vote. We like to think about the population as "what is the
                        biggest set of individuals we could get data from?"<br><br>It is not always possible to collect
                        a census either. While it is ideal to get data from every single member of a population, there
                        are usually roadblocks that prevent this such as the following (to name a few):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People unwilling to participate</li>
                        <li>Insufficient time to collect data</li>
                        <li>Limited financing to conduct the study</li>
                        <li>Ethical issues involved with collecting certain pieces of data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example 3: Sample vs Population</h2>
                        <p>We want to study the heights of students at ABC College so we set up a table in the student
                            resources building to collect data from our fellow students as they come into the building.
                            This college has an enrollment of 2000 students. We obtain the heights of 281 students over
                            a course of three days. For this scenario, identify both the population and the sample as
                            well as some factors preventing us from obtaining a census.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution: Sample vs Population</h2>
                        <p>The population would be all 2000 students that are enrolled in the college as that would be
                            the ideal amount of individuals to collect height data from.<br><br>The sample is just the
                            281 student heights we got over the course of the three days.<br><br>With us collecting data
                            in this manner, this limits us from getting data from students that do not visit the student
                            recourses building. Because of this, we probably do not have a representative sample meaning
                            this sample would not be the best for trying to study the heights of ALL students at ABC
                            College: this data could be used instead to just make inferences about students that use the
                            student resources building.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Since it is usually impossible and/or impractical to obtain data from the entire population, we
                        implement sampling techniques to collect a sample that is representative of the population we
                        wish to study. We will cover various sampling techniques in future articles, but the primary
                        idea is that data must ALWAYS be collected in a random way if it is to be used to understand the
                        bigger population.</p>
                    <h2>Statistics and Parameters</h2>
                    <p>In statistics, understanding the distinction between key concepts is essential for analyzing data
                        effectively. Two foundational terms, parameter and statistic, play a crucial role in summarizing
                        and interpreting information.</p>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Parameter</h2>
                        <p>A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Statistic</h2>
                        <p>A statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample. It is
                            calculated from a sample drawn from some population that is intended to be studied.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>These two terms can be confusing so here is a helpful memory device for sorting out which term
                        goes with what value:<br><br>Population = Parameter (both start with a P)<br><br>Sample =
                        Statistic (both start with a S).<br><br>Try the example below to determine if you can identify
                        numerical values as parameters or statistics.</p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example 4: Statistic vs Parameter</h2>
                        <p>For each scenario below, tell if each of the <strong>bolded</strong> values are a parameter
                            or a statistic. If the value is a statistic, tell what could be changed about the scenario
                            to make the bolded word become a parameter.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A study of all 2223 passengers aboard the Titanic found that <strong>706</strong>
                                survived when it sank.</li>
                            <li>In a large sample of households, the median annual income per household for high school
                                graduates is <strong>$19,856</strong> (based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau).</li>
                            <li>Among the Senators in the current Congress, <strong>45%</strong> are Democrats.</li>
                            <li>The author measured the voltage supplied to his home on 40 different days, and the
                                average (mean) value is <strong>123.7</strong> volts.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution: Statistic vs Parameter</h2>
                        <p>Here are the solutions to the above example problem:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The number 706 is a <strong>parameter</strong></li>
                            <li>The value $19,856 is a <strong>statistic</strong>. It would be a parameter by removing
                                "sample of households" and adding "all the households in Tennessee" or "every households
                                in the county": putting in wording that indicates it is a complete collection of
                                households.</li>
                            <li>The percentage 45% is a <strong>parameter</strong></li>
                            <li>The value 123.7 is a <strong>statistic</strong>. This would be a parameter if the "40
                                different days" was change to "all 365 days of the year" or "all 30 days of this month"
                                to indicate that the voltage measurements are a complete collection.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now that we have introduced some of the primary terms used in this course, we can talk about what
                        all will make up "statistics". This course will cover how to organize and summarize data, a
                        process known as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Data can be summarized through graphs
                        or by numerical measures which will be discussed in future readings. After some time in the
                        course we will introduce formal methods for drawing conclusions about a population from reliable
                        sample data. This process is known as <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Effective data
                        interpretation relies on sound data collection methods and careful analysis. While the course
                        includes numerous mathematical formulas, the focus is primarily on understanding the data rather
                        than performing extensive calculations, which can be handled by calculators or computers. A
                        solid grasp of statistical fundamentals fosters confidence in decision-making.</p>
