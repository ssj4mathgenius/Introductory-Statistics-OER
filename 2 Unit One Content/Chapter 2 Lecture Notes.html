                        <p>Distributions hold significant theoretical importance in this course. In this section, we will
                            learn about frequency distributions, which is the basis for many of the concepts in this course.
                        </p>

                            <p>The <strong>frequency</strong> of a data point is how many times it shows up in the data set.

                            <h3>What is a Frequency Distribution?</h3>
                            <p>A <strong>frequency distribution</strong> is a table that lists either the raw data or
                                classes (defined below) in the first column and corresponding frequency in the second
                                column.</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- End Definition Wrapper -->
                        <p>Before the advent of computers, frequency distributions were created manually. This involved
                            arranging the data in ascending order and marking a tally for each occurrence of a data point.
                            This process was prone to human errors such as miscounting or duplicating data.</p>
                        <p>With computers, creating frequency distributions is much faster and more accurate than manual
                            methods. Tools like SPSS, MATLAB, and Excel offer advanced statistical capabilities. GeoGebra,
                            however, is particularly useful in educational settings because of its simplicity and
                            visualization tools, making it ideal for students learning this process.</p>

                                the Frequency column represent the number of years from 1950 to 2023 that reported that many
                                deaths.&nbsp; For example, 10 years between 1950 and 2023 reported 1 death caused by
                                Tornadoes in Tennessee.</p>

                    <p>While the above example works well for small data sets, many frequency distributions group data into
                        ranges instead of listing each unique data point individually. For example, we could group the
                        number of years with 0 to 4 deaths, 5 to 9 deaths, 10 to 14 deaths, and so on, creating a row in
                        the table for each of these ranges. These ranges are called&nbsp;<strong>classes</strong> or
                        <strong>bins</strong> in statistics.</p>
                    <p>If we created a new class for every 5 deaths, we would need 16 classes to cover all the data,
                        from the class with 0 to 4 deaths up to the class with 75 to 79 deaths. However, this approach
                        would lead to many classes with a frequency of 0, which makes the table less meaningful. To
                        avoid this, we want the ranges to be large enough to capture meaningful data but not so small
                        that most classes are empty.</p>
                    <p>So how many classes should we have? As the researcher, you get to decide, but a good rule of
                        thumb is to aim for 5 to 20 classes. Once the number of classes is chosen, the formula below
                        will help determine the range for each class, known as the <strong>class width</strong>.</p>

                        <h2 class="definition-header">How do you calculate class width?</h2>
                        <p>The<strong> class width</strong> is the size of each class and determines how data is
                            grouped. It is calculated using the formula&nbsp; \[ \text{class width } =
                            \dfrac{\text{largest value } - \text{smallest value }}{\text{number of classes}}.\]</p>
                        <p>If the result is a decimal, always round up to the next whole number to ensure all data
                            points fit into the intervals. For example, if the calculated width is 9.38, round it up to
                            10. This ensures every data point fits into one of the classes without gaps.</p>
                        <h4>What does this number mean?</h4>
                        <p>The class width measures the difference between the smallest numbers in successive
                            classes.&nbsp; For example, if our first class is from 0 to 4 deaths and our second class is
                            from 5 to 9 deaths, then the class width is 5 since \(5-0=5\).</p>
                        <h4>Can I choose my own class width?</h4>
                        <p>Yes!&nbsp; This formula isn't perfect, and occasionally excludes the maximal data
                            point.&nbsp; Sometimes, you have a preferred width you would like to use.&nbsp; It is up to
                            you!&nbsp; For academic purposes though, we will always use the formula unless a problem
                            requires otherwise.</p>

                    <p>Class widths, along with the minimum value of the data set, define what is known as the

                            not equal to) the maximal value in our data set.</p>
                        <p>For example, if we wanted a class width of 5 for the classes of tornado deaths, the boundary
                            points are 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, \(\ldots\), 70, 75, 80.</p>

                        <p>Yes!&nbsp; If you choose your own class size, typically you also choose the first boundary
                            points as well.&nbsp; Just remember to keep adding the class width until you get a number

                                <p>Now, if you count up the number of classes in the table, notice there is 11 different
                                    classes.&nbsp; Why is there 11 when Number of Classes is set to 10?&nbsp; Sometimes, the
                                    largest value of the data set gets counted in the last classes when it should not be.&nbsp;
                                    It is a quirk of how GeoGebra defined class frequencies. (And there is nothing wrong with
                                    that the method GeoGebra uses; it is just uses a slightly different definition of boundary
                                    points than was given above.)&nbsp; To correct for this difference, the Frequency
                                    Distribution Tool automatically adds an extra class by default.&nbsp; But, notice that the
                                    last class has a frequency of 0. That means the extra class wasn't needed, and we can click
                                    on the click on the&nbsp;<strong>Deselect if Last Row Equals 0&nbsp;</strong>checkbox to
                                    remove it. Therefore, we get the following frequency distribution.</p>

                                <p>The&nbsp;<strong>classes/bins</strong> column gives the range of values for each class,
                                    always including the first number in the range and excluding the last number in the
                                    range.&nbsp; For example, the interval <strong>0 to 9</strong> means the range of values
                                    starting at 0 and include all the numbers up to but not including 10.&nbsp; The Frequency,
                                    as before, tells us the number of years whose number of deaths fell into that range of
                                    values.&nbsp; For example, there were 64 years that had 0 up to 10 deaths.</p>
                                <h5>What is the Use Interval Notation Checkbox?</h5>
                                <p>Some instructors/websites prefer to use interval notation to describe the classes/bins.&nbsp;
                                    For example,&nbsp;<strong>0 to 9</strong> would be written as $[0,10)$ since $[0$ indicates
                                    to start and include 0 and $10)$ means to include all the number up to but not including
                                    10.&nbsp; When the check box is clicked, the frequency distribution looks like this.</p>

                    <h1>How to Create Relative Frequency Distributions</h1>
                    <p>An important concept related to frequency is <strong>relative frequency</strong>, and it is a
                        foundational concept for several key topics in this course.&nbsp; We will use relative
                        frequencies when discussing cumulative frequencies (discussed below), creating histograms,
                        studying probability and probability distributions, and using statistical inference to discuss
                        population proportions. &nbsp;By connecting data analysis to probability theory and statistical
                        inference, relative frequency serves as a bridge between descriptive and inferential methods in
                        a statistics course.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>What is Relative Frequency?</h3>
                        <p><b>Relative Frequency&nbsp;</b>has two interpretations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For&nbsp;<strong>raw data</strong>, relative frequency is the percentage of times that a
                                particular value appears in a data set.</li>
                            <li>For <strong>data sorted into classes</strong>, relative frequency is the percentage of
                                data that appear in a given class.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In both cases, the formula for relative frequency is identical: \[\text{relative frequency
                            }=\dfrac{\text{{frequency}}}{{n}},\] where \(n\) is the number of data points in the
                            sample.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Notice that this will always give a percentage as a decimal, so we will always write
                            \(0.3947\) instead of \(39.47\)% in this course. &nbsp;Using percentages instead of decimals
                            can cause errors in many of the formulas because most statistical formulas use relative
                            frequencies rather than percentages to ensure accurate calculations. &nbsp;</p>
                        <h4 class="warning">⚠️ Warning ⚠️</h4>
                        <p>Relative frequencies will always yield a number between 0 and 1. If you get a number larger
                            than 1 or a negative number, double check your work because you made a calculation error!

                            by dividing the class frequency by the total number of year, 74, as follows:
                            \[\dfrac{{64}}{{74}}\approx 0.8649.\] Thus, \(0.8649\) is the relative frequency for 0 to
                            10, meaning \(86.49\%\) of the years from 1950 to 2023 had 0 to 10 deaths (excluding

                    <h1>How to Compute Cumulative Frequency Distributions</h1>
                    <p>Another important concept related to frequency is cumulative frequency, which keeps a running
                        total of frequencies up to a specific value or class.&nbsp; This provides insight into how data
                        accumulates over a specific range of values, and is fundamental in understanding ideas such as
                        median, quartiles, interquartile ranges, computing area under the uniform, normal, and student T
                        curves. By synthesizing raw data into meaningful patterns, cumulative frequency serves as a
                        stepping stone to deeper statistical concepts, emphasizing the relationship between individual
                        data points and their overall context within a dataset.&nbsp;</p>

                            6 years had 2 deaths, and 7 years had 3 deaths. Adding up the number of years gives
                            \[32+10+6+7=55,\] so the cumulative frequency for \(3\) is 55. Therefore, 55 years between

                            we will use in this course, as they require values to be expressed as decimals for accurate
                            computation.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a formula, we can express this as \[\text{relative cumulative

                            Now, let’s pick a data point, such as 5. To calculate the relative cumulative frequency,
                            divide its cumulative frequency by the total number of data points:
                            \[\dfrac{{61}}{{74}}\approx 0.8243.\] This means that \(82.43\%\) of the years had 5 or

                <p>The shape of a frequency distribution is an important geometric property that we can determine from

                    various points during the course. Before diving into the different shapes, it is helpful to
                    understand some important concepts related to distributions: the <strong>peak</strong> and
                    <strong>tails</strong> of a distribution.</p>

                    <h3>What are the tails of a distribution?</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>tails of a distribution</strong> refer to the far ends of the distribution, which
                        represent the extreme values of the dataset. For example, in a histogram, the left tail
                        corresponds to the smallest values, while the right tail corresponds to the largest values. The
                        shape and behavior of the tails can provide insights into the skewness and outliers of the
                        distribution.</p>

                <p>Now that we understand the tails and peaks of frequency distributions, let’s examine the different
                    shapes these distributions can take.</p>
                <h2>Shapes of Distributions</h2>
                <!--Definition-->
                <div class="definition">
                    <h3>What are the different shapes of frequency distributions?</h3>
                    <p>There are three main shapes: <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>multimodal</strong>, and
                        <strong>uniform</strong>.</p>
                    <h4>Unimodal Distributions (single-peak)</h4>
                    <p>Unimodal distributions have a single peak in their histogram. These distributions begin with
                        small bars that gradually increase in height from left to right, reach a peak at one class, and
                        then decrease from left to right. There are three subtypes of unimodal
                        distributions:&nbsp;<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>skew-left</strong>, and
                        <strong>skew-right</strong>.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h5>Normal Distributions (aka bell-shaped distribution)</h5>
                    <p>This is the most important distribution in the course. A normal distribution is symmetric, with
                        its peak located at the center. Its tails extend in both directions but gradually get closer and
                        closer to the horizontal axis as they extend outward. The shape of the histogram for a normal
                        distribution resembles a bell, hence the name "bell-shaped distribution."</p>

                    </p>
                    <h5>Skew-Left Distributions</h5>
                    <p>A skew-left distribution (also called negatively skewed) is a distribution where the left tail is
                        longer than the right tail. In these distributions, the majority of the data values are
                        concentrated toward the right side of the histogram, with fewer values on the left. This creates
                        a tail that extends toward smaller values.</p>

                            width="399" height="238"></p>
                    <h5>Skew-Right Distributions</h5>
                    <p>A skew-right distribution (also called positively skewed) is a distribution where the right tail
                        is longer than the left tail. In these distributions, the majority of the data values are
                        concentrated toward the left side of the histogram, with fewer values on the right. This creates
                        a tail that extends toward larger values.</p>

                            alt="Distribution is right-skewed because its right tail is longer than its left tail."
                            title="Distribution is right-skewed because its right tail is longer than its left tail."
                            width="401" height="232"></p>
                    <h4>Multimodal Distributions (multiple peaks)</h4>
                    <p>Multimodal distributions have multiple peaks in their histogram. A <strong>bimodal
                            distribution</strong> has two peaks, a <strong>trimodal distribution</strong> has three, and
                        anything with four or more peaks is just called a <strong>multimodal distribution</strong>.
                        While we won’t cover multimodal distributions in this course, you may encounter them in advanced
                        statistics courses.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h4>Uniform Distributions</h4>
                    <p>Uniform distributions have bars that area all approximately the same height (give or take a small
                        margin of error).</p>
                    <p><img src="../images/uniform2.png"

                            width="399" height="260"></p>
                    <h5>Homework Note</h5>
                    <p>Homework problems will ask you to identify the shape of a distribution. The easiest way to
                        determine the shape is by drawing or visualizing a curve through the tops of the bars, as shown
                        in the examples above for unimodal and multimodal distributions.&nbsp; If the distribution is
                        uniform, all the bars should be approximately the same height.</p>

                <h1>How to Construct Stem-and-Leaf Plots</h1>
                <p>Stem-and-leaf plots are a simple, effective way to organize and visualize numerical data. They reveal patterns, clusters, and unusually small or large data, making them valuable for understanding distributions. This page covers how to create these plots, handle repeated values, decide on rounding, split stems for clarity, and compare datasets using back-to-back plots. Through examples and explanations, you’ll learn to master stem-and-leaf plots for various data types.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>What is a Stem-and-Leaf Plot?</h3>
                <p>A <strong>stem-and-leaf plot</strong> is a way to organize rounded numerical data by splitting each value into a <strong>stem</strong> (the leading digit(s), such as tens) and a <strong>leaf </strong>(the trailing digit(s), based on the chosen rounding level). For example, if the dataset includes \(32\), \(35\), and \(41\), rounded to the nearest one, the plot would look like: \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 5 \\ 4 &amp;\mid 1 \end{align*} \] Here, the stem represents the tens, and the leaf represents the ones. The leaf represents the level of rounding, allowing the plot to effectively display and organize data&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>What if I have two or more data point with the same value?</h4>
                <p>If the same value shows up more than once in a dataset, it will get a leaf for each time it appears.&nbsp; If we change our example to \(32\), \(35\), \(35\), \(41\), the plot would look like \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 5 \ 5 \\ 4 &amp;\mid 1 \end{align*} \] and the two 5's represent the fact that 35 showed up twice in the data.</p>

                <h3>Where should I round my data?</h3>
                <p>There is a bit of an art to deciding how to create a stem-and-leaf plot. The best stems are those that appear frequently in your data and group it meaningfully.</p>
                <p>For example, if most of your data falls between 300 and 340, you are likely to have many numbers in the ranges 300–309, 310–319, 320–329, and 330–339. In this case, 30, 31, 32, and 33 would be good choices for stems, and the one’s digit would make a good leaf.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if most of your data ranges from 500 to 900, you will likely see many numbers in the broader ranges 500–599, 600–699, 700–799, and 800–899. In this case, 5, 6, 7, and 8 would be better choices for stems. By rounding to the nearest 10, the tens digit becomes your leaf.</p>
                <p>The goal is to create a plot that organizes the data clearly and effectively, without being cluttered or too sparse.</p>

                <h3>What does it mean to split a stem?</h3>
                <p>To <strong>split stems</strong> in a stem-and-leaf plot means dividing each stem into smaller groups to spread out the data and make the plot easier to interpret. This is useful when a single stem contains too many leaves, resulting in a cluttered display. Splitting the stem divides it into two rows. The first row contains numbers where the rounded digit is between \(0\) and \(4\), and the second row includes numbers where the rounded digit is between \(5\) and \(9\).</p>
                <p>For example, if the dataset includes \(32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39\), a traditional plot would use \(3\) as the stem with all leaves grouped together: \[ 3 \mid 2 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 9 \] The split plot would look like this: \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 4 \\\\ 3 &amp;\mid 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 9 \end{align*} \] In this example, \(32\) and \(34\) are placed in the first row because their ones digits are \(2\) and \(4\). Numbers \(35, 36, 37, 38, 39\) are placed in the second row because their ones digits are \(5, 6, 7, 8, 9\). This method provides a clearer view of the data’s distribution by reducing overcrowding.</p>

                <li>a single stem has too many leaves, making the plot crowded and difficult to read.</li>

                <h1>How to Construct Dot Plots</h1>
<p>A <strong>dot plot</strong> is a simple visual tool for representing data, where each dot corresponds to a specific data point.. It effectively displays frequency distributions, highlighting patterns, peaks, and left/right-skew.&nbsp; Dot plots are ideal for small to moderately sized datasets in various fields such as education, biology, and economics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dot Plots</h2>
<!--Definition-->
<div class="definition">
<h3>How do I make a Dot Plot?</h3>
<p>To create a dot plot by hand, follow these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a horizontal axis to represent the range of values, labeling it appropriately.</li>
<li>Divide the axis into evenly spaced intervals to cover all data points.</li>
<li>For each value in the dataset, place a dot above its corresponding position on the axis, stacking dots vertically for repeated values.</li>
<li>Add a title and labels to clarify the data being represented.</li>

<p>The dots are correctly placed, but the \(x\)-axis labels start at 4.9 and increase by 1. This happens because the Dot Plot Generator defaults to integers. Since the data is rounded to one decimal place, select \(0.1\) from the dropdown menu. (Note: Due to an unresolved bug, \(0.1\) appears as \(1/10\).) Adjusting this fixes the \(x\)-scale, making all ticks and labels display correctly.</p>

<h2>Interpreting Dot Plots</h2>
<p>Dot plots give us another way to see the shape of the distribution.&nbsp; But unlike histograms, it gives us a way to identity the exact data points that are either unusually small or unusually large compared to the other data points.</p>
<p>If we look at the dot plot for Example 1 and draw a curve over it<br><img src="/content/enforced/9945978-MATH1530_STATS_OER/3 Unit One Content/2 Frequency Distributions and Their Displays/../2%20Frequency%20Distributions%20and%20Their%20Displays/dotplot_example1_6_with_curve.png" alt="The dot plot from Example 1. A curve is drawn over it, showing a skew-left distribution." title="The dot plot from Example 1. A curve is drawn over it, showing a skew-left distribution." width="399" height="243">&nbsp;<br>we see that since 13 is smaller than the rest of the data clustered around the peak at 17, and this unusually small data point skews the distribution to the left by elongating the left tail.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we draw a curve over the dot plot for example 2<br><img src="/content/enforced/9945978-MATH1530_STATS_OER/3 Unit One Content/2 Frequency Distributions and Their Displays/../2%20Frequency%20Distributions%20and%20Their%20Displays/dotplot_example2_3_with_curve.png" alt="The dot plot from Example 1.

<h1>How to Construct Bar Graphs</h1>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>bar graph&nbsp;</strong>uses proportional vertical or horizontal bars to represent the frequency of categorical data.&nbsp; This allows for the quick comparison of different categories of data.&nbsp; A common variation of a bar graph is the&nbsp;<strong>Pareto graph</strong>, which sorts the bars from tallest to shortest.</p>
<h2>Bar Graphs</h2>
<p>Bar graphs are a powerful tool to visually compare categories of data. To understand how they work, let us explore an example that demonstrates the process of creating a bar graph using our <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/tmu6ja9y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bar and Pie Chart Generator Tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>A survey of 100 people was conducted to determine their favorite fast food restaurant among various national brands. The results are summarized in the table below. Using the data, create a bar graph to represent the distribution of responses.<br><button onclick="copyToClipboard('favfastfood')">Copy Data to Clipboard</button></p>

<h2>Pareto Graphs</h2>
<p>While standard bar graphs are effective at showcasing categorical data, there are scenarios where sorting the bars in descending order provides greater clarity. This leads us to a specialized variation of the bar graph known as the <strong>Pareto graph</strong>.&nbsp; Let's modify Example 1 so that all the bars are sorted from largest to smallest..</p>

<h1>How to Create Pie Graphs</h1>
A&nbsp;<strong>pie chart</strong> is statistical graph that divides a circle up into slices whose area is proportional to the quantity of the category that it represents.&nbsp; Pie charts are useful when there are a small selection of categories, and the categories represent every possible option under consideration.<br>
<h2>Conditions for Using a Pie Graph</h2>
<!--Begin Explaination Block-->
<div class="definition">
<h3>When can I use a Pie Graph?</h3>
<p>A pie graph should only be used under two specific conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data can belong to exactly one of the categories.</li>
<li>Categories must be parts of a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the following table summarizes the numbers of stars a particular store was rated during a 30-day period.</p>
<table style="width: auto; height: 234.643px;"><caption style="display: table-caption; width: max-content;">Store Ratings Over a 30-Day Period</caption>
<thead>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<th scope="col">Star Rating</th>
<th scope="col">Percentage of Ratings</th>
<th scope="col">Number of Transactions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<td>1 Star</td>
<td>5%</td>
<td>16,468</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<td>2 Stars</td>
<td>12%</td>
<td>39,522</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<td>3 Stars</td>
<td>8%</td>
<td>26,348</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<td>4 Stars</td>
<td>20%</td>
<td>65,871</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 39.1071px;">
<td>5 Stars</td>
<td>55%</td>
<td>181,144</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that every category is included, and since each transaction can only be associated to exact one rating, the first condition is satisfied as well.&nbsp; This data could be made into a Pie Chart.</p>
</div>
<!--End Explaination Block-->At times, categorical data may be provided that violates one or both of these conditions. In some cases, it might still be possible to use a pie graph, but not always. In our first example, the data cannot be used to create a pie graph.&nbsp;
<h3 class="example-header">Example 1</h3>
<p>Suppose a survey asked which department(s) a customer purchased from during their last visit to a particular department store. Explain why a pie graph cannot be used with the following set of data.</p>
<table style="width: auto;"><caption style="display: table-caption; width: max-content;">Percentage of People Shopping in Each Department</caption>

<div class="solution">
<h4 class="solution-header">Solution</h4>
<p>Although this data is helpful for stores to understand which departments are shopped the most, it is not suitable for creating a pie chart because customers may shop in multiple departments during a single visit. Unless the question is reframed to something like, "Which department was your primary reason for visiting the store today?" customers will fall into more than one category, violating the first condition.</p>
<p>Moreover, this categorical overlap causes the percentages to exceed 100%, which goes against the pie chart's requirement that all parts must represent a complete whole.</p>
<p>Additionally, the list of departments may not be exhaustive (e.g., common departments like "Health &amp; Beauty" are missing), further disqualifying this data for use in a pie chart.</p>
<p>$$\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}$$</p>
</div>
<!-- End Solution Block-->Many examples can be resolved by simply adding an "Other" category to the results. This is commonly done because some responses may not fit within the predefined categories in a survey question. Furthermore, when several categories have relatively small percentages compared to the main categories, they are often grouped into an "Other" option. This approach highlights the primary categories and makes the overall results easier to interpret, avoiding an overload of less significant choices for the reader. Our next example demonstrates an appropriate use of adding an "Other" category.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-10">
<h3 class="example-header">Example 2</h3>
<p>A survey was conducted to determine the types of activities people prefer on weekends. A survey of 1,303 people were asked, "Which of the follow activities do you most prefer to do on weekends? Please select only one option." The percentages were tabulated and reported in the table below. Explain why a pie chart cannot be created from this table and suggest how it could be corrected.</p>

<div class="solution">
<h4 class="solution-header">Solution</h4>
<p>Since the survey question required respondents to select only one activity, we know that each person belongs to exactly one category. However, the given percentages only add up to 98%, which indicates that 2% of the data is missing. To fix this, we can create an "Other" category to account for the remaining 2%. This ensures that all respondents are included, and the categories represent parts of a whole. Once the missing data is accounted for, the conditions for creating a pie chart are satisfied.</p>
<p>$$\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}$$</p>
</div>
<!-- End Solution Block-->
<p>As a final example, it is important to recognize that some reported data may have percentages that add up to 100%, but the categories are not truly parts of a whole. This often confuses students who focus too heavily on the idea that the parts must sum to 100%, without recognizing that the data does not represent components of a single whole. The next example provides a demonstration of this type of situation.</p>
<h3 class="example-header">Example 3</h3>
<p>A survey asked 1,373 respondents, "What is your favorite activity while on vacation?" The responses are summarized in the following table. Explain why this data cannot be used to make a Pie Chart.</p>
<table style="width: auto;"><caption style="display: table-caption; width: max-content;">Vacation Activity Preferences</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Activity</th>
<th scope="col">Percentage</th>

<tr>
<td>Outdoor adventures (e.g., hiking or kayaking)</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shopping</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!--Solution Starts Here-->
<div class="solution">
<h4 class="solution-header">Solution</h4>
<p>In this case, the percentages add up to 100%, but the responses do not represent parts of a whole. Each response reflects a preference for a single activity while on vacation, rather than components of a unified whole. For example, another type of response could have been attending cultural events such as festivals, concerts, or other local performances.</p>
<p>This illustrates how data that sums to 100% can still fail to meet the criteria of representing parts of a single whole.</p>
