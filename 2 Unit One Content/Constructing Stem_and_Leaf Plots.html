    <h1>Constructing Stem-and-Leaf Plots</h1>
    <p>Stem-and-leaf plots are a simple, effective way to organize and visualize numerical data. They
        reveal patterns, clusters, and unusually small or large data, making them valuable for
        understanding distributions. This page covers how to create these plots, handle repeated values,
        decide on rounding, split stems for clarity, and compare datasets using back-to-back plots.
        Through examples and explanations, you’ll learn to master stem-and-leaf plots for various data
        types.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Stem-and-Leaf Plots</h2>
    <!--Definition -->
    <div class="definition">
        <h3>What is a Stem-and-Leaf Plot?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>stem-and-leaf plot</strong> is a way to organize rounded numerical data by
            splitting each value into a <strong>stem</strong> (the leading digit(s), such as tens) and a
            <strong>leaf </strong>(the trailing digit(s), based on the chosen rounding level). For
            example, if the dataset includes \(32\), \(35\), and \(41\), rounded to the nearest one, the
            plot would look like: \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 5 \ 4 &amp;\mid 1 \end{align*} \]
            Here, the stem represents the tens, and the leaf represents the ones. The leaf represents
            the level of rounding, allowing the plot to effectively display and organize data&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>What if I have two or more data point with the same value?</h4>
        <p>If the same value shows up more than once in a dataset, it will get a leaf for each time it
            appears.&nbsp; If we change our example to \(32\), \(35\), \(35\), \(41\), the plot would
            look like \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 5 \ 5 \ 4 &amp;\mid 1 \end{align*} \] and the
            two 5's represent the fact that 35 showed up twice in the data.</p>

        <h3>Where should I round my data?</h3>
        <p>There is a bit of an art to deciding how to create a stem-and-leaf plot. The best stems are
            those that appear frequently in your data and group it meaningfully.</p>
        <p>For example, if most of your data falls between 300 and 340, you are likely to have many
            numbers in the ranges 300–309, 310–319, 320–329, and 330–339. In this case, 30, 31, 32, and
            33 would be good choices for stems, and the one’s digit would make a good leaf.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if most of your data ranges from 500 to 900, you will likely see many
            numbers in the broader ranges 500–599, 600–699, 700–799, and 800–899. In this case, 5, 6, 7,
            and 8 would be better choices for stems. By rounding to the nearest 10, the tens digit
            becomes your leaf.</p>
        <p>The goal is to create a plot that organizes the data clearly and effectively, without being
            cluttered or too sparse.</p>

        <p>The stem-and-leaf plot reveals the shape of the data distribution. Like a histogram, the
            lengths of the stems show the data’s shape. By rotating the plot \(90^\circ\)
            counterclockwise, you can visualize the distribution over the tops of the bars. In this
            case, the plot shows a normal distribution.<br><img

    <h2>Split Stems</h2>
    <!--Definition -->
    <div class="definition">
        <h3>What does it mean to split a stem?</h3>
        <p>To <strong>split stems</strong> in a stem-and-leaf plot means dividing each stem into smaller
            groups to spread out the data and make the plot easier to interpret. This is useful when a
            single stem contains too many leaves, resulting in a cluttered display. Splitting the stem
            divides it into two rows. The first row contains numbers where the rounded digit is between
            \(0\) and \(4\), and the second row includes numbers where the rounded digit is between
            \(5\) and \(9\).</p>
        <p>For example, if the dataset includes \(32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39\), a traditional plot would
            use \(3\) as the stem with all leaves grouped together: \[ 3 \mid 2 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 9
            \] The split plot would look like this: \[ \begin{align*} 3 &amp;\mid 2 \ 4 \\ 3 &amp;\mid
            5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 9 \end{align*} \] In this example, \(32\) and \(34\) are placed in the first
            row because their ones digits are \(2\) and \(4\). Numbers \(35, 36, 37, 38, 39\) are placed
            in the second row because their ones digits are \(5, 6, 7, 8, 9\). This method provides a
            clearer view of the data’s distribution by reducing overcrowding.</p>

        <h3>When should I split my stems?</h3>
        <p>You should split stems in a stem-and-leaf plot when...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a single stem has too many leaves, making the plot crowded and difficult to read.</li>
            <li>precision matters, such as with decimal data or closely spaced values.</li>
            <li>one stem has significantly more leaves than others.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To keep the <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/payaagsb" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Stem-and-Leaf Plot Generator</a> running smoothly, it is important to
            determine the stems and leaves before starting. Since our data ranges from about 20.5 to
            63.4, there would be too much variation in the stems used the data rounded to the first
            decimal place.&nbsp; The most logical choice is to use the tens digit as the stem and the
            ones digit as the leaf since this will only give us leaves from 2 to 6. Set the tool’s
            rounding to 1,</p>

        <p>While it was clear from the original back-to-back plot that we had values clusters in the
            thirties, what wasn't clear was how much more extra data we had on the high end in Program B
            until we split the stems.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Stem-and-leaf plots are a powerful tool for organizing data and identifying patterns. By learning
        to construct, interpret, and refine these plots using techniques like splitting stems and
        back-to-back comparisons, you can effectively analyze and communicate data insights.</p>
