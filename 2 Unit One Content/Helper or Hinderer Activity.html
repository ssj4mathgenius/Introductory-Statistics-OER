    <h1>Helper Hinderer Student Work</h1>

    <h2>Part 1 - Introduction</h2>

    <p>If 16 infants participated in this study, how many do you think chose the helper toy? Why? List some factors you think might be at play when the infants go to make their choice of toy.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

    <p>There are 3 possible hypotheses for the outcomes of this experiment regarding how many infants choose a particular toy. See if you can identify the possible outcomes below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hypothesis 1: A majority of the children will choose ________________________</li>
        <li>Hypothesis 2: A majority of the children will choose ________________________</li>
        <li>Hypothesis 3:</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Assume that infants DO NOT prefer the helper or the hinderer toy. What would be the most likely outcome (i.e., how many infants will choose the helper toy) when this study is conducted on 16 infants?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

    <p>Still assuming that infants show NO preference between the helper or the hinderer, what kind of results (for the number of infants choosing the helper toy) would NOT surprise you when this study is conducted on 16 infants? What is the lowest number and highest number you would be "OK" with, result-wise?</p>

    <p><strong>Lowest Acceptable Number Choosing Helper (for our group):</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Highest Acceptable Number Choosing Helper (for our group):</strong></p>

    <p>The researchers actually found that ________ of the 16 infants in the study selected the helper toy. If it is REALLY the case that infants show NO preference between the helper and hinderer toy, do you find the researchers' results surprising? Why or why not?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

    <h2>Part 2 â€“ Exploration with a Simulation</h2>

    <p>Find a coin flipping simulation online and flip a coin 16 times. Count the number of heads you got and write it down. Repeat this 3 more times. Each person in your group will do this (so everyone will do 4 sets of 16 flips).</p>

    <p>Watch the instructor make the dot plot of the class's results. What is the name of the distribution your class's results formed?</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution Name:</strong></p>

    <p>Does it seem like the results obtained by these researchers (see number 5 on Part One) would be surprising under the null hypothesis that infants do not have a genuine preference for either toy? Explain.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

    <p>What is the chance of getting 14 heads in 16 flips from the simulation?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> ____ %</p>
