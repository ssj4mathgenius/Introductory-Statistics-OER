    <h1>Parameters and Statistics</h1>
    <p>In statistics, understanding the distinction between key concepts is essential for analyzing data
        effectively. Two foundational terms, parameter and statistic, play a crucial role in summarizing
        and interpreting information.</p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Parameter?</h2>
        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>parameter</strong></span> is a numerical measurement
            describing
            some characteristic of a population.</p>
    </div>
    <p>An example of a parameter is the average height of all people living in Nashville, TN, and its
        surrounding suburbs. While it’s theoretically possible to measure the height of every individual
        in
        the area to determine this parameter, doing so would require a complete census, which is
        impractical. Many people might refuse to participate, and certain groups, such as homeless
        individuals or undocumented immigrants, can be difficult to locate and include. As a result,
        although this exact number exists, the inability to conduct a full census means it will likely
        remain unknown.</p>
    <p>This is why we take samples. While we can’t calculate this number for the entire population, we
        can
        measure the heights of a subset of individuals who are willing to participate. The average
        height
        calculated from this subset is called a statistic, which is used to estimate the unknown
        parameter.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Statistic?</h2>
        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>statistic</strong></span> is a numerical measurement
            describing
            some characteristic of a sample. It is
            calculated from a sample drawn from some population that is intended to be studied.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Returning to our Nashville example, we could take a random sample of 500 individuals and
        calculate
        their average height. If we get an average height of <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong>, then this
        value is a <strong>statistic</strong> since it is a value derived from a sample.</p>
    <p> <strong>Note:</strong> To ensure accuracy, the sample should be randomly selected from different
        neighborhoods and include a diverse mix of ages, genders, ethnicities, and socio-economic
        backgrounds. This approach can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the average height of
        people living in the Nashville area, provided it is free from bias or sampling errors, which we
        will
        discuss shortly.</p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Telling the Difference Between a Parameter and a Statistic</h2>
        <p>These two terms can be confusing so here is a helpful memory device for sorting out which
            term
            goes with what value:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parameter</strong> refers to a <strong>Population</strong> (both start with a P)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Statistic</strong> refers to a <strong>Sample</strong> (both start with a S).
            </li>
        </ul>
        Try the example below to determine if you can identify
        numerical values as parameters or statistics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Statistic vs Parameter
        </h2>
        <p>For each scenario below, tell if each of the <strong>bolded</strong> values are a parameter
            or a statistic. If the value is a statistic, tell what could be changed about the scenario
            to make the bolded word become a parameter.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A study of all 2223 passengers aboard the Titanic found that <strong>706</strong>
                survived when it sank.</li>
            <li>In a large sample of households, the median annual income per household for high school
                graduates is <strong>$19,856</strong> (based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau).</li>
            <li>Among the Senators in the current Congress, <strong>45%</strong> are Democrats.</li>
            <li>The author measured the voltage supplied to his home on 40 different days, and the
                average (mean) value is <strong>123.7</strong> volts.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="solution">
            <h2 class="solution-header">Solution: Statistic vs Parameter</h2>
            <p>Here are the solutions to the above example problem:</p>

            <div class="dontprint">
                <ol>
                    <li>The number 706 is a <strong>parameter</strong></li>
                    <li>The value $19,856 is a <strong>statistic</strong>. It would be a parameter by
                        removing
                        "sample of households" and adding "all the households in Tennessee" or "every
                        households
                        in the county": putting in wording that indicates it is a complete collection of
                        households.</li>
                    <li>The percentage 45% is a <strong>parameter</strong></li>
                    <li>The value 123.7 is a <strong>statistic</strong>. This would be a parameter if
                        the
                        "40
                        different days" was change to "all 365 days of the year" or "all 30 days of this
                        month"
                        to indicate that the voltage measurements are a complete collection.</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding the distinction between parameters and statistics is fundamental in statistical
        analysis. While parameters describe entire populations, they are often theoretical and difficult
        to
        calculate due to practical constraints. Statistics, on the other hand, are calculated from
        samples
        and provide a way to estimate these unknown parameters. By carefully designing samples to be
        representative and minimizing bias, we can make reliable conclusions about populations from data
        we
        collect from samples. Using statistics to estimate parameters forms the foundation for much of
        the
        work in statistics, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions from data and apply them to
        real-world contexts.</p>
    <p>Now that we have introduced several of the key terms used in this course, we can explain a little
        more in-depth what a statistics course entails. This course will cover how to organize and
        summarize
        data, a
        process known as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Data can be summarized through graphs
        or by numerical measures which will be discussed in future readings. After some time in the
        course we will introduce formal methods for drawing conclusions about a population from reliable
        sample data. This process is known as <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Effective data
        interpretation relies on sound data collection methods and careful analysis. While the course
        includes numerous mathematical formulas, the focus is primarily on understanding the data rather
        than performing extensive calculations, which can be handled by calculators or computers. A
        solid grasp of statistical fundamentals fosters confidence in decision-making.</p>
