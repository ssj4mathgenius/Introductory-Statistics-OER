                        <!-- Introduction -->
                        <p>The Empirical Rule provides a simple way to understand the distribution of data in normal
                            distributions. It states that for approximately normal data sets, the percentage of values
                            within one, two, or three standard deviations of the mean follows predictable patterns.</p>
                        <h2>The Empirical Rule</h2>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h3>What is the Empirical Rule?</h3>
                            <p>Let \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) be the mean and standard deviation for a population that is
                                normally distributed.&nbsp; Then the data of the normal distribution followings the
                                following guidelines.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the
                                        mean.</strong>&nbsp; In other words, 68% of the data is between \(\mu-\sigma\)
                                    and \(\mu+\sigma\).</li>
                                <li><strong>Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the
                                        mean.</strong>&nbsp; In other words, 95% of the data is between \(\mu-2\cdot
                                    \sigma\) and \(\mu+2\cdot \sigma\).</li>
                                <li><strong>Approximately 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the
                                        mean.</strong>&nbsp; In other words, 99.70% of the data is between
                                    \(\mu-3\cdot\sigma\) and \(\mu+3\cdot\sigma\).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Notes</h4>

                                <li>When we draw a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, we
                                    often label the \(x\)-axis with the values of \(\mu\), \(\mu\pm\sigma\), \(\mu\pm
                                    2\cdot\sigma\), and \(\mu\pm 3\cdot\sigma\).&nbsp; For example, if \(\mu=85\) and
                                    \(\sigma=15\), our normal distribution looks like this:<br><br><img

                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Traditionally, the empirical rule required you to add an subtract areas in certain
                            ways.&nbsp; Thankfully, with modern technology, we can focus on the most important aspect of
                            the Empirical Rule: the relationship between relative frequency (percentage of data) and a
                            range of values from a normal distribution.</p>

                                    <p>Since we want the percentage greater than a number, we will change the tail-type
                                        to <strong>right-tail</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure to change the \(\mu\) and
                                        \(\sigma\) to the correct values since, when you change tail type, they will
                                        default back to 0 and 1, respectively&nbsp; Since 70 is two numbers to the right
                                        of the peak, it is two standard deviations above the mean.&nbsp; Therefore,

                        <p>The Empirical Rule is a powerful tool for understanding how data is distributed in a normal
                            distribution. By knowing the mean and standard deviation, you can estimate the percentage of
                            values within a range. This helps in identifying what is typical and what may be unusual in
                            a dataset.</p>
