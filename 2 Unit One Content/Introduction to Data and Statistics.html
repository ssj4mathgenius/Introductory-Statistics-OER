    <h1>Introduction to Data and Statistics</h1>
    <p>Statistics are widely used in everyday life, from crime and sports to education and real estate.
        Whether reading a newspaper, watching TV, or browsing the internet, we often encounter
        statistical information based on samples. This data helps assess the accuracy of claims to help
        us all make better and informed decisions. Understanding statistical methods is essential for
        analyzing information thoughtfully, whether buying a house, managing a budget, or working in
        fields like economics, business, psychology, biology, or law. This beginning module introduces
        the fundamentals of statistics including the mindset for being a statistics student, learning
        the relevant definitions, explaining how data is collected, and how to identify reliable data.
    </p>
    <h2>Terminology for Statistics</h2>
    <p>Before learning about what all is involved in statistics, it is important to introduce a few key
        words that will be used all throughout our study of statics.</p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is Data?</h2>
        <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Data</strong></span> is any collections of observations (such
            as measurements, genders, survey responses,
            etc.).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Data</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>An instructor asks their class how many hours they studied last week and the class
                responded with various times ranging from 30 mins to 4 hours. All of these "times" given
                by the students would be considered Data.</li>
            <li>A survey online asks users to identify their favorite fast food restaurant. Two of the
                selections made are Zaxbys and McDonald's. These two selections are considered data.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is Statistics?</h2>
        <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Statistics</strong></span> is the science of planning studies
            and experiments, obtaining data, and then
            organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based
            on the data.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Statistics operates by using studies, surveys, polls, and other data collection tools to gather
        information from a subset of a larger group, allowing insights about the entire group. This
        principle reflects the core purpose of statistics and the objective of this course:
        understanding some larger group by analyzing data from a representative subset.</p>
    <p>To further understand this core principle, let's cover a few more key terms that will be used
        during this course as we progress towards our objective.</p>
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">The Larger Group</h2>
        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>population</strong></span> is the complete collection of all
            individuals (scores, people, measurements, and
            so on) to be studied. The collection is complete in the sense that it includes all of the
            individuals to be studied.</p>
        <p>Individuals often refer to people, but not always. For example, individuals can also refer to
            animals in a wildlife study, products in a quality control inspection, plants in a botanical
            experiment, or even stars in an astronomical survey.</p>
        <p>If you do collect data from every individual, you have collected a <strong>census</strong>
            which is a collection of data from every member of the population.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Consider the example of products in a quality control inspection. As the manufacturer, you want
        all your products to be free of defects. You have two options: test every product or test a
        small selection and use the results to evaluate the entire product line. Most manufacturers
        choose the latter because testing every product is more expensive and may damage or destroy the
        items being tested.</p>
    <p>This example highlights the difference between a <strong>census</strong>, which involves testing
        every product, and a <strong>sample</strong>, which involves testing only a subset. </p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">The Smaller Group</h2>
        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>sample</strong></span> is a subset (or smaller group) of
            members selected from a population.</p>
        <p>Some examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>Political polls study a randomly selected group of households across various states to
                estimate trends for the entire U.S. population. This approach is more efficient and
                cost-effective than conducting a full census, as political organizations and journalists
                lack the resources or time for a true census.</li>
            <li>The professor surveys only 5 of their 30 students about their sleep habits, rather than
                collecting data from every student.</li>
            <li>The top 8 scores from a competition are sampled to assess whether the overall skill
                level of the athletes is improving.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Populations vs Samples
        </h2>
        <p>Say that a statistics professor is studying the amount of sleep his students get each night
            and is
            only able to collect data from <strong>ten</strong> of his thirty students. What is the
            sample and what is the population in this scenario?
        </p>

            <p class="dontprint">The <strong>sample</strong> in this example will be the 10 pieces of
                sleep data the professor was able to obtain.</p>
            <p class="dontprint">The <strong>population</strong> that the professor intends to study is
                ALL his students.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Part A: This data is from a sample because we are collecting age information for
                        only some of the customers, not all of them.</li>
                    <li>Part B: This data is from a population because the community college has

                <p class="blacksquare">\[ \tag*{\(\blacksquare\)} \]</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Many times, the difference between a population and a sample is not clear.&nbsp; Be careful with
        the
        following examples—they represent common errors in distinguishing a population from a sample.

    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Populations vs Samples
            Part 4</h2>
        <p>Identify the population and sample for this situation: A company surveys 850 of its employees
            and
            finds that 520 are satisfied with their job.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
            <div class="inches" data-height="1.5in"></div>
            <div class="dontprint">
                <p>Many people assume the 850 employees is the population because it’s a large number,
                    but this is
                    incorrect. A population includes all members of a group, while specific numbers,
                    like 850,
                    generally refer to a sample.</p>
                <p>In this case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 850 employees surveyed represent a sample of the population of all employees
                        at the
                        company.</li>
                    <li>The 520 is a statistic calculated from the sample, not the sample itself.</li>

        <p>An ecologist wants to study the nesting habits of birds in a particular forest. They identify
            1800
            trees in the northwest region of the forest and randomly select 300 trees to observe. Of
            those, 120
            trees contain nests.</p>

            This college has an enrollment of 2000 students. We obtain the heights of 281 students over
            a course of three days. For this scenario, identify both the population and the sample as

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding the distinction between populations and samples is fundamental to statistical
        analysis.
        Populations represent the entire group under study, while samples are subsets used to make
        inferences about the population. Although a census provides comprehensive data, it is often
        impractical for large populations, making sampling a more efficient and feasible approach.
        Recognizing these differences and correctly identifying populations and samples in various
        contexts
        ensures accurate interpretations and better decision-making in studies.</p>
