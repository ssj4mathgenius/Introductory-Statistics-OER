                        <h1>Introduction to Data and Statistics</h1>
                        <p>Statistics are widely used in everyday life, from crime and sports to education and real estate.
                            Whether reading a newspaper, watching TV, or browsing the internet, we often encounter
                            statistical information based on samples. This data helps assess the accuracy of claims to help
                            us all make better and informed decisions. Understanding statistical methods is essential for
                            analyzing information thoughtfully, whether buying a house, managing a budget, or working in
                            fields like economics, business, psychology, biology, or law. This beginning module introduces
                            the fundamentals of statistics including the mindset for being a statistics student, learning
                            the relevant definitions, explaining how data is collected, and how to identify reliable data.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Terminology for Statistics</h2>
                        <p>Before learning about what all is involved in statistics, it is important to introduce a few key
                            words that will be used all throughout our study of statics.</p>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is Data?</h2>
                            <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Data</strong></span> is any collections of observations (such
                                as measurements, genders, survey responses,
                                etc.).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="example">
                            <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Data</h2>
                            <ol>
                                <li>An instructor asks their class how many hours they studied last week and the class
                                    responded with various times ranging from 30 mins to 4 hours. All of these "times" given
                                    by the students would be considered Data.</li>
                                <li>A survey online asks users to identify their favorite fast food restaurant. Two of the
                                    selections made are Zaxbys and McDonald's. These two selections are considered data.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is Statistics?</h2>
                            <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Statistics</strong></span> is the science of planning studies
                                and experiments, obtaining data, and then
                                organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based
                                on the data.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Statistics operates by using studies, surveys, polls, and other data collection tools to gather
                            information from a subset of a larger group, allowing insights about the entire group. This
                            principle reflects the core purpose of statistics and the objective of this course:
                            understanding some larger group by analyzing data from a representative subset.</p>
                        <p>To further understand this core principle, let's cover a few more key terms that will be used
                            during this course as we progress towards our objective.</p>
                        <div class="page-break"></div>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">The Larger Group</h2>
                            <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>population</strong></span> is the complete collection of all
                                individuals (scores, people, measurements, and
                                so on) to be studied. The collection is complete in the sense that it includes all of the
                                individuals to be studied.</p>
                            <p>Individuals often refer to people, but not always. For example, individuals can also refer to
                                animals in a wildlife study, products in a quality control inspection, plants in a botanical
                                experiment, or even stars in an astronomical survey.</p>
                            <p>If you do collect data from every individual, you have collected a <strong>census</strong>
                                which is a collection of data from every member of the population.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Consider the example of products in a quality control inspection. As the manufacturer, you want
                            all your products to be free of defects. You have two options: test every product or test a
                            small selection and use the results to evaluate the entire product line. Most manufacturers
                            choose the latter because testing every product is more expensive and may damage or destroy the
                            items being tested.</p>
                        <p>This example highlights the difference between a <strong>census</strong>, which involves testing
                            every product, and a <strong>sample</strong>, which involves testing only a subset. </p>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">The Smaller Group</h2>
                            <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>sample</strong></span> is a subset (or smaller group) of
                                members selected from a population.</p>
                            <p>Some examples include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Political polls study a randomly selected group of households across various states to
                                    estimate trends for the entire U.S. population. This approach is more efficient and
                                    cost-effective than conducting a full census, as political organizations and journalists
                                    lack the resources or time for a true census.</li>
                                <li>The professor surveys only 5 of their 30 students about their sleep habits, rather than
                                    collecting data from every student.</li>
                                <li>The top 8 scores from a competition are sampled to assess whether the overall skill
                                    level of the athletes is improving.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Understanding the distinction between populations and samples is fundamental to statistical
                            analysis.
                            Populations represent the entire group under study, while samples are subsets used to make
                            inferences about the population. Although a census provides comprehensive data, it is often
                            impractical for large populations, making sampling a more efficient and feasible approach.
                            Recognizing these differences and correctly identifying populations and samples in various
                            contexts
                            ensures accurate interpretations and better decision-making in studies.</p>

                        <h1>Parameters and Statistics</h1>
                        <p>In statistics, understanding the distinction between key concepts is essential for analyzing data
                            effectively. Two foundational terms, parameter and statistic, play a crucial role in summarizing
                            and interpreting information.</p>

                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Parameter?</h2>
                            <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>parameter</strong></span> is a numerical measurement
                                describing
                                some characteristic of a population.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>An example of a parameter is the average height of all people living in Nashville, TN, and its
                            surrounding suburbs. While it’s theoretically possible to measure the height of every individual
                            in
                            the area to determine this parameter, doing so would require a complete census, which is
                            impractical. Many people might refuse to participate, and certain groups, such as homeless
                            individuals or undocumented immigrants, can be difficult to locate and include. As a result,
                            although this exact number exists, the inability to conduct a full census means it will likely
                            remain unknown.</p>
                        <p>This is why we take samples. While we can’t calculate this number for the entire population, we
                            can
                            measure the heights of a subset of individuals who are willing to participate. The average
                            height
                            calculated from this subset is called a statistic, which is used to estimate the unknown
                            parameter.
                        </p>
                        <div class="definition">

                                describing
                                some characteristic of a sample. It is
                                calculated from a sample drawn from some population that is intended to be studied.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Returning to our Nashville example, we could take a random sample of 500 individuals and
                            calculate
                            their average height. If we get an average height of <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong>, then this
                            value is a <strong>statistic</strong> since it is a value derived from a sample.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Note:</strong> To ensure accuracy, the sample should be randomly selected from different
                            neighborhoods and include a diverse mix of ages, genders, ethnicities, and socio-economic
                            backgrounds. This approach can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the average height of
                            people living in the Nashville area, provided it is free from bias or sampling errors, which we
                            will

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Understanding the distinction between parameters and statistics is fundamental in statistical
                            analysis. While parameters describe entire populations, they are often theoretical and difficult
                            to
                            calculate due to practical constraints. Statistics, on the other hand, are calculated from
                            samples
                            and provide a way to estimate these unknown parameters. By carefully designing samples to be
                            representative and minimizing bias, we can make reliable conclusions about populations from data
                            we
                            collect from samples. Using statistics to estimate parameters forms the foundation for much of
                            the
                            work in statistics, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions from data and apply them to
                            real-world contexts.</p>
                        <p>Now that we have introduced several of the key terms used in this course, we can explain a little
                            more in-depth what a statistics course entails. This course will cover how to organize and
                            summarize
                            data, a
                            process known as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Data can be summarized through graphs
                            or by numerical measures which will be discussed in future readings. After some time in the
                            course we will introduce formal methods for drawing conclusions about a population from reliable
                            sample data. This process is known as <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Effective data
                            interpretation relies on sound data collection methods and careful analysis. While the course
                            includes numerous mathematical formulas, the focus is primarily on understanding the data rather
                            than performing extensive calculations, which can be handled by calculators or computers. A
                            solid grasp of statistical fundamentals fosters confidence in decision-making.</p>

                        <h1>Classifying Data Types</h1>
                        <p>Understanding data begins with recognizing its classification and the processes used to collect
                            it. Data can broadly be categorized into two classifications with each providing a unique
                            insight into a population or sample allowing for a more targeted analysis of particular aspects.
                            When collecting data it is important to implement an appropriate sampling method so that the
                            data can be used to learn something about the population that it originated. This section will
                            detail data types as well as the common sampling methods used to collect that data.</p>
                        <h2>Data Classification</h2>
                        <p>Data originates from either a population or a sample and can be classified into two main
                            categories: <strong>Qualitative Data</strong> and <strong>Quantitative Data</strong>.</p>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is Qualitative Data?</h2>
                            <p>Qualitative data (or categorical data) categorizes or describes attributes of a population,
                                often using words or letters. Examples include
                            <ul>
                                <li>hair color (e.g., black, brown)</li>
                                <li>blood type (e.g., AB+, O-)</li>
                                <li>Zip Codes (e.g., 38401, 49715, 26537)</li>
                                <li>car types(e.g., Toyota, Explorer, Jeep)</li>
                            </ul>
                            This type of data is not
                            generally suited for mathematical analysis meaning that averages or standard deviations are
                            not meaningful (e.g. you wouldn't be able to average hair colors).</p>

                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is Quantitative Data?</h2>
                            <p>Quantitative data represents numerical values obtained by counting or measuring attributes.
                                Examples include
                            <ul>
                                <li>weight (pounds, ounces, grams, etc.)</li>

                            </ul>
                            Quantitative data is further divided into two subcategories:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="blanked"><b>Discrete data</b></span> results when the number of possible
                                    values is either a finite
                                    number or a “countable” number (i.e. the number of possible values is 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
                                    ). Examples might include number of phone calls: 0 calls, 1 call, 2 calls, etc.</li>
                                <li><span class="blanked"><b>Continuous data</b></span> results from infinitely many
                                    possible values that correspond to
                                    some continuous scale that covers a range of values without gaps, interruptions, or
                                    jumps. This includes almost measurements of distance, time, volume, temperature,
                                    mass, or combinations of any of these. For example, weights like 2.4 grams and 7.5
                                    pounds
                                    would be continuous data since the scale they originate from has infinite divisions
                                    (i.e. you could get the measurement as precise as possible).</li>

                                                    $5.75), money is not measured on a continuous scale because it is
                                                    typically
                                                    limited to two decimal places (cents). Thus, it is quantitative and

                        <p>Understanding the classification of data and its levels of measurement is essential for
                            conducting accurate and meaningful statistical analysis. By distinguishing between qualitative
                            and quantitative data, and recognizing whether data is discrete or continuous, we can better
                            select appropriate methods for summarizing and analyzing information. Similarly, identifying the
                            level of measurement—nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio—ensures we apply the correct
                            statistical tools and interpret results accurately. These foundational concepts provide the
                            framework for understanding how data is collected, categorized, and analyzed, paving the way for
                            more advanced statistical techniques.</p>

                        <h1>Levels of Measurement</h1>
                        <p>Statistics involves understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data, and a key component is
                            determining the "level of measurement" of data. Levels of measurement are important because they
                            determine the types of statistical analyses that can be performed and ensure proper
                            interpretation of data. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and
                            ratio. Each builds upon the previous level, providing more information about the data.</p>

                            <h2 class="definition-header">Different Levels of Measurement</h2>
                            <p><b>Nominal Level:</b> Data at this level are categorized without any order. For example,
                                trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense: putting
                                pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful. Examples might include anything that is
                                qualitative data where there is no inherent order that can be prescribed: gender, eye color,
                                types of fruits, etc.</p>
                            <p><b>Ordinal Level:</b> Data are categorized with a meaningful order, but differences between
                                categories are not measurable. Examples include rankings in a competition or survey
                                responses such as "satisfied," "neutral," or "dissatisfied."</p>
                            <p><b>Interval Level:</b> Data have meaningful order, measurable differences, but no true zero
                                point. Examples include temperature in Celsius or years on a calendar. Interval level data
                                can be used in calculations, but since there is no true zero point it isn't meaningful to
                                make a ratio. For example: 6 PM isn't twice as big as 3 PM despite there being three hours
                                between the two times of day.</p>
                            <p><b>Ratio Level:</b> Data have a meaningful order, measurable differences, and a true zero
                                point, allowing for meaningful ratios. Examples include weight, height, or age.</p>

                        <h1>Data Collection and Bias</h1>
                        Effective data collection is essential for reliable statistical studies. Observational studies
                        measure characteristics without intervention, while experiments impose treatments to observe their
                        effects. Key techniques like randomization, replication, and blinding reduce bias and improve
                        accuracy. Understanding and addressing sources of bias, such as response bias and nonresponse,
                        ensures valid and meaningful results.&nbsp;Data Collection

                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is Replication?</h2>
                            <p><strong>Replication:</strong> Assign enough individuals to each treatment to reduce the
                                variation in the results. This ensures that similar experiments conducted under the same
                                conditions will yield similar results.</p>
                            <p>For example, a medical researcher is testing the effectiveness of a new drug to lower blood
                                pressure. To ensure reliable results, the researcher assigns 500 participants to the
                                treatment group (receiving the drug) and 500 participants to the control group (receiving a
                                placebo). By assigning a large number of participants to each group, the researcher reduces
                                the variability in results that might occur due to chance or individual differences.
                                Replication ensures that the outcomes are consistent and reproducible if the experiment is
                                repeated under the same conditions.</p>
                            <p>We will learn in Chapter 6 why larger sample sizes lead to less variation.</p>

                            <h2 class=definition-header> What is Randomization?</h2>
                            <p><strong>Randomization:</strong> Select subjects randomly so that variations in results occur
                                purely by chance, not external factors.</p>
                            <p>For example, in a clinical trial testing a pain medication, 200 participants are randomly
                                assigned to two groups: 100 receive the medication, and 100 receive a placebo. Randomization
                                ensures that differences between the groups are due to the treatment and not factors like
                                age or health.</p>
                            <p>As the study is replicated, probability theory, the subject of Chapter 4, predicts that the
                                effects of random variation diminish. Consistently similar results across replications
                                increase confidence that the findings reflect the true population characteristics</p>

                                            perfectly represent the population. This error can cause the results to differ
                                            from the
                                            true population characteristics purely by chance.</li>

                            <p><strong>Blinding</strong> ensures that subjects do not know whether they are receiving a
                                placebo or an actual treatment. This reduces the risk of bias caused by participants'
                                expectations influencing the results.</p>
                            <h4>What is a Single-Blind Experiment?&nbsp;</h4>
                            <p>In a&nbsp;<strong>single-blind experiment</strong>, the participants do not know whether they
                                are receiving the treatment or a placebo, but the researchers administering the treatment do
                                know.</p>
                            <p>For example, in a clinical trial testing a new allergy medication, participants are randomly
                                divided into two groups. One group receives the allergy medication, and the other group
                                receives a placebo. The participants do not know which group they are in, but the
                                researchers administering the medication do. This prevents participants' expectations from
                                influencing the results, though it still leaves room for potential researcher bias.</p>
                            <h4>What is a Double-Blind Experiment?&nbsp;</h4>
                            <p>In a <strong>double-blind experiment</strong>, neither the participants nor the researchers
                                administering the treatment know who is receiving the treatment or the placebo.</p>
                            <p>For example, in the same allergy medication trial, participants are randomly divided into two
                                groups. One group receives the allergy medication, and the other group receives a placebo.
                                Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatment know who is in
                                which group. This eliminates both participant and researcher bias, ensuring that the results
                                are as unbiased as possible.</p>

                                    and
                                    they meditated daily for a month. The other group was simply told to relax more. At the

                                    The meditation group now had less anxiety.</p>

                                        <p>The psychologists’ concern about the lack of blindness refers to the fact that
                                            the
                                            experimenter, who rated the subjects’ anxiety levels both before and after the

                                            knew which group each subject belonged to (meditation or relaxation). This lack
                                            of blindness
                                            could introduce bias in the following ways:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The experimenter might have unconsciously expected the meditation group to
                                                show greater
                                                improvement, leading them to rate that group’s anxiety levels more
                                                favorably.</li>
                                            <li>Since the experimenter knew the treatment assignments, their personal
                                                beliefs about
                                                meditation's effectiveness could have influenced their ratings, even if
                                                unintentionally.
                                            </li>

                                        <p>To reduce bias, the experimenter could have implemented a double-blind procedure.
                                            In a
                                            double-blind experiment,&nbsp; the experimenter conducting the interviews would

                                            which group each subject was in. This would ensure that the ratings are based
                                            solely on the
                                            subjects’ behavior and responses, without being influenced by the experimenter’s

                                        <p>By using proper blinding, the anxiety ratings would be less likely to reflect the

                        <p>Accurate data collection is the foundation of any statistical analysis, providing the raw
                            information needed to draw meaningful conclusions about populations. However, the process of
                            collecting data is not without its challenges. This section explores key aspects of data
                            collection and common sources of bias, including response bias, wording effects, and
                            nonresponse. By understanding these challenges, we can design better methods for collecting
                            high-quality data and minimize the impact of bias on our results.</p>

                            sampling methods, while simpler, often introduce bias and limit the reliability of conclusions.

                                    take a proportionate random sample from each group. For instance, sample students from
                                    various departments to represent a college population.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cluster Sampling:</strong> Divide the population into clusters, then randomly
                                    select some clusters and include all members from those clusters in the sample. For
                                    example, randomly select departments in a college and survey all their students.</li>
                                <li><strong>Systematic Sampling:</strong> Randomly select a starting point and pick every
                                    nth member from a population list. For example, choose every 50th name in a phone book
                                    for a survey</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Non-Random Sampling Techniques</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Convenience Sampling:</strong> Individuals are chosen based on accessibility and
                                    ease rather than randomness. For example, Surveying the first 20 people entering a
                                    grocery store about their shopping habits.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Nonrandom sampling methods, such as <strong>convenience sampling</strong>, should generally be
                            avoided as they can lead to biased results. For example, surveying the first 20 customers
                            entering a coffee shop might overrepresent certain groups, such as early risers or individuals
                            with flexible schedules, while excluding others, like night-shift workers.</p>
                        <p>Random sampling methods aim to reduce bias and ensure representativeness by giving all
                            individuals an equal chance of selection. However, even random sampling is subject to
                            <strong>random sampling error</strong>, where chance variations may cause the sample to differ
                            from the population. Larger sample sizes reduce this error, improving the reliability of the
                            results. Researchers must also address <strong>nonrandom sampling errors</strong> like
                            undercoverage, nonresponse, and volunteer response bias, as these can further skew
                            results.&nbsp; Well will discussing these sampling errors shortly.

                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Random Sampling Error?</h2>
                            <p>A <strong>random sampling error</strong> occurs when there is a discrepancy between a sample
                                result and the true population result. This type of error arises purely due to chance, as a
                                sample is only a subset of the population and may not perfectly represent it. For example,
                                if a random sample of 50 students is drawn from a school of 1,000, the sample mean test
                                score might differ slightly from the population mean simply by chance.</p>
                            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Random sampling error is unavoidable in any sampling process but
                                can be minimized by increasing the sample size.</p>

                            <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Nonrandom Sampling Error?</h2>
                            <p>There are three important types of nonrandom sampling errors: <strong>undercoverage</strong>,
                                <strong>nonresponse</strong>, and <strong>volunteer response</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>What is Undercoverage?</strong>Undercoverage occurs when some groups in the
                                    population are systematically excluded from the sampling process, making the sample
                                    unrepresentative of the entire population.
                                    <p><strong>Example</strong>A survey conducted by randomly calling landline phone
                                        numbers will exclude people who only use cell phones, such as younger adults,
                                        leading to biased results.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>What is Nonresponse?</strong>Nonresponse occurs when a portion of the
                                    selected sample does not participate in the study, and their responses may differ
                                    systematically from those who do respond.
                                    <p><strong>Example</strong>In a mail survey asking about personal finances, people
                                        who feel uncomfortable sharing financial information may choose not to respond,
                                        skewing the results toward those who are more open about their finances.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>What is a Volunteer Response?</strong>&nbsp;Volunteer response occurs when
                                    participants self-select into the sample rather than being randomly chosen, often
                                    leading to an overrepresentation of individuals with strong opinions.
                                    <p><strong>Example</strong>An online poll about a controversial policy is likely to
                                        attract participants who feel strongly for or against the policy, while those who
                                        are neutral or indifferent are less likely to respond.</p>

                                collection process. These errors can occur regardless of how the sample is chosen. Examples
                                include mistyping data into a computer, misinterpreting survey questions, or using faulty
                                measuring instruments.</p>
                            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Non-sampling errors can often be reduced by careful planning,
                                training, and implementing quality control measures during data collection and entry.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Effective sampling is key to obtaining reliable and meaningful data. Random sampling methods,
                            like stratified and systematic sampling, reduce bias and provide representative samples, while
                            nonrandom methods, such as convenience sampling, often produce unreliable results. Identifying
                            and addressing common sampling errors, including undercoverage and nonresponse, further improves
                            the quality of data collection. By carefully selecting sampling techniques and minimizing
                            errors, researchers can ensure their findings are accurate and applicable.</p>

                            Experimental design ensures reliable and unbiased results by structuring studies to isolate
                            treatment effects and control variability. This section covers three key designs—completely
                            randomized, randomized block, and matched pairs.
                        </p>

                            <p>A <strong>completely randomized design</strong> assigns treatments to subjects entirely at
                                random, without grouping or blocking. This design works well when the subjects are similar
                                and there are no additional variables that need to be controlled.</p>
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A clinical trial randomly assigns participants to receive one of
                                three medications to treat high blood pressure. Results are compared across all

                                    the other treatment at a later time under similar conditions. Compare the results for
                                    that individual.
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A participant tests two different types of running shoes by
                                        running a set distance with each pair on different days. Their times are compared to

                        <p>Good experimental design minimizes bias, controls variability, and ensures valid comparisons.
                            Completely randomized designs work for homogeneous groups, randomized block designs account for
                            shared characteristics, and matched pairs designs allow detailed within-subject or paired
                            comparisons. Proper design leads to meaningful and reliable results.</p>
