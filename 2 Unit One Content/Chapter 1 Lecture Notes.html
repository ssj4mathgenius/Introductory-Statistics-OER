                    <h1>Introduction to Data and Statistics</h1>
                    <p>Statistics are widely used in everyday life, from crime and sports to education and real estate.
                        Whether reading a newspaper, watching TV, or browsing the internet, we often encounter
                        statistical information based on samples. This data helps assess the accuracy of claims to help
                        us all make better and informed decisions. Understanding statistical methods is essential for
                        analyzing information thoughtfully, whether buying a house, managing a budget, or working in
                        fields like economics, business, psychology, biology, or law. This beginning module introduces
                        the fundamentals of statistics including the mindset for being a statistics student, learning
                        the relevant definitions, explaining how data is collected, and how to identify reliable data.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Terminology for Statistics</h2>
                    <p>Before learning about what all is involved in statistics, it is important to introduce a few key
                        words that will be used all throughout our study of statics.</p>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">What is Data?</h2>
                        <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Data</strong></span> is any collections of observations (such
                            as measurements, genders, survey responses,
                            etc.).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Data</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>An instructor asks their class how many hours they studied last week and the class
                                responded with various times ranging from 30 mins to 4 hours. All of these "times" given
                                by the students would be considered Data.</li>
                            <li>A survey online asks users to identify their favorite fast food restaurant. Two of the
                                selections made are Zaxbys and McDonald's. These two selections are considered data.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="definition-header">What is Statistics?</h2>
                        <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Statistics</strong></span> is the science of planning studies
                            and experiments, obtaining data, and then
                            organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based
                            on the data.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Statistics operates by using studies, surveys, polls, and other data collection tools to gather
                        information from a subset of a larger group, allowing insights about the entire group. This
                        principle reflects the core purpose of statistics and the objective of this course:
                        understanding some larger group by analyzing data from a representative subset.</p>
                    <p>To further understand this core principle, let's cover a few more key terms that will be used
                        during this course as we progress towards our objective.</p>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">The Larger Group</h2>
                        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>population</strong></span> is the complete collection of all
                            individuals (scores, people, measurements, and
                            so on) to be studied. The collection is complete in the sense that it includes all of the
                            individuals to be studied.</p>

                        <p>Individuals often refer to people, but not always. For example, individuals can also refer to
                            animals in a wildlife study, products in a quality control inspection, plants in a botanical
                            experiment, or even stars in an astronomical survey.</p>

                        <p>If you do collect data from every individual, you have collected a <strong>census</strong>
                            which is a collection of data from every member of the population.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Consider the example of products in a quality control inspection. As the manufacturer, you want
                        all your products to be free of defects. You have two options: test every product or test a
                        small selection and use the results to evaluate the entire product line. Most manufacturers
                        choose the latter because testing every product is more expensive and may damage or destroy the
                        items being tested.</p>

                    <p>This example highlights the difference between a <strong>census</strong>, which involves testing
                        every product, and a <strong>sample</strong>, which involves testing only a subset. </p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">The Smaller Group</h2>
                        <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>sample</strong></span> is a subset (or smaller group) of
                            members selected from a population.</p>
                        <p>Some examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Political polls study a randomly selected group of households across various states to
                                estimate trends for the entire U.S. population. This approach is more efficient and
                                cost-effective than conducting a full census, as political organizations and journalists
                                lack the resources or time for a true census.</li>
                            <li>The professor surveys only 5 of their 30 students about their sleep habits, rather than
                                collecting data from every student.</li>
                            <li>The top 8 scores from a competition are sampled to assess whether the overall skill
                                level of the athletes is improving.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <p>Understanding the distinction between populations and samples is fundamental to statistical analysis.
                    Populations represent the entire group under study, while samples are subsets used to make
                    inferences about the population. Although a census provides comprehensive data, it is often
                    impractical for large populations, making sampling a more efficient and feasible approach.
                    Recognizing these differences and correctly identifying populations and samples in various contexts
                    ensures accurate interpretations and better decision-making in studies.</p>

                <h1>Parameters and Statistics</h1>
                <p>In statistics, understanding the distinction between key concepts is essential for analyzing data
                    effectively. Two foundational terms, parameter and statistic, play a crucial role in summarizing
                    and interpreting information.</p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Parameter?</h2>
                    <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>parameter</strong></span> is a numerical measurement describing
                        some characteristic of a population.</p>
                </div>

                <p>An example of a parameter is the average height of all people living in Nashville, TN, and its
                    surrounding suburbs. While it’s theoretically possible to measure the height of every individual in
                    the area to determine this parameter, doing so would require a complete census, which is
                    impractical. Many people might refuse to participate, and certain groups, such as homeless
                    individuals or undocumented immigrants, can be difficult to locate and include. As a result,
                    although this exact number exists, the inability to conduct a full census means it will likely
                    remain unknown.</p>

                <p>This is why we take samples. While we can’t calculate this number for the entire population, we can
                    measure the heights of a subset of individuals who are willing to participate. The average height
                    calculated from this subset is called a statistic, which is used to estimate the unknown parameter.
                </p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">What is a Statistic?</h2>
                    <p>A <span class="blanked"><strong>statistic</strong></span> is a numerical measurement describing
                        some characteristic of a sample. It is
                        calculated from a sample drawn from some population that is intended to be studied.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Returning to our Nashville example, we could take a random sample of 500 individuals and calculate
                    their average height. If we get an average height of <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong>, then this
                    value is a <strong>statistic</strong> since it is a value derived from a sample.</p>
                <p> <strong>Note:</strong> To ensure accuracy, the sample should be randomly selected from different
                    neighborhoods and include a diverse mix of ages, genders, ethnicities, and socio-economic
                    backgrounds. This approach can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the average height of
                    people living in the Nashville area, provided it is free from bias or sampling errors, which we will
                    discuss shortly.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Understanding the distinction between parameters and statistics is fundamental in statistical
                    analysis. While parameters describe entire populations, they are often theoretical and difficult to
                    calculate due to practical constraints. Statistics, on the other hand, are calculated from samples
                    and provide a way to estimate these unknown parameters. By carefully designing samples to be
                    representative and minimizing bias, we can make reliable conclusions about populations from data we
                    collect from samples. Using statistics to estimate parameters forms the foundation for much of the
                    work in statistics, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions from data and apply them to
                    real-world contexts.</p>

                <p>Now that we have introduced several of the key terms used in this course, we can explain a little
                    more in-depth what a statistics course entails. This course will cover how to organize and summarize
                    data, a
                    process known as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Data can be summarized through graphs
                    or by numerical measures which will be discussed in future readings. After some time in the
                    course we will introduce formal methods for drawing conclusions about a population from reliable
                    sample data. This process is known as <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Effective data
                    interpretation relies on sound data collection methods and careful analysis. While the course
                    includes numerous mathematical formulas, the focus is primarily on understanding the data rather
                    than performing extensive calculations, which can be handled by calculators or computers. A
                    solid grasp of statistical fundamentals fosters confidence in decision-making.</p>

                <h1>Types of Data and Ways of Sampling</h1>
                <p>Understanding data begins with recognizing its classification and the processes used to collect
                    it. Data can broadly be categorized into two classifications with each providing a unique
                    insight into a population or sample allowing for a more targeted analysis of particular aspects.
                    When collecting data it is important to implement an appropriate sampling method so that the
                    data can be used to learn something about the population that it originated. This section will
                    detail data types as well as the common sampling methods used to collect that data.</p>
                <h2>Data Classification</h2>
                <p>Data originates from either a population or a sample and can be classified into two main
                    categories: <strong>Qualitative Data</strong> and <strong>Quantitative Data</strong>.</p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">What is Qualitative Data?</h2>
                    <p>Qualitative data (or categorical data) categorizes or describes attributes of a population,
                        often using words or letters. Examples include hair color (e.g., black, brown), blood type
                        (e.g., AB+, O-), Zip Codes (e.g., 38401, 49715, 26537), or car types(e.g., Toyota, Explorer,
                        Jeep). This type of data is not
                        generally suited for mathematical analysis meaning that averages or standard deviations are
                        not meaningful (e.g. you wouldn't be able to average hair colors).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">What is Quantitative Data?</h2>
                    <p>Quantitative data represents numerical values obtained by counting or measuring attributes.
                        Examples include weight, pulse rate, the number of people/objects, etc. Quantitative data is
                        further divided into two subcategories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="blanked"><b>Discrete data</b></span> results when the number of possible
                            values is either a finite
                            number or a “countable” number (i.e. the number of possible values is 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
                            ). Examples might include number of phone calls: 0 calls, 1 call, 2 calls, etc.</li>
                        <li><span class="blanked"><b>Continuous data</b></span> results from infinitely many
                            possible values that correspond to
                            some continuous scale that covers a range of values without gaps, interruptions, or
                            jumps. This includes almost measurements of distance, time, volume, temperature,
                            mass, or combinations of any of these. For example, weights like 2.4 grams and 7.5 pounds
                            would be continuous data since the scale they originate from has infinite divisions
                            (i.e. you could get the measurement as precise as possible).</li>

                <h2>Levels of Measurement</h2>
                <p>Statistics involves understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data, and a key component is
                    determining the "level of measurement" of data. Levels of measurement are important because they
                    determine the types of statistical analyses that can be performed and ensure proper
                    interpretation of data. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and
                    ratio. Each builds upon the previous level, providing more information about the data.</p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">Different Levels of Measurement</h2>
                    <p><b>Nominal Level:</b> Data at this level are categorized without any order. For example,
                        trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense: putting
                        pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful. Examples might include anything that is
                        qualitative data where there is no inherent order that can be prescribed: gender, eye color,
                        types of fruits, etc.</p>
                    <p><b>Ordinal Level:</b> Data are categorized with a meaningful order, but differences between
                        categories are not measurable. Examples include rankings in a competition or survey
                        responses such as "satisfied," "neutral," or "dissatisfied."</p>
                    <p><b>Interval Level:</b> Data have meaningful order, measurable differences, but no true zero
                        point. Examples include temperature in Celsius or years on a calendar. Interval level data
                        can be used in calculations, but since there is no true zero point it isn't meaningful to
                        make a ratio. For example: 6 PM isn't twice as big as 3 PM despite there being three hours
                        between the two times of day.</p>
                    <p><b>Ratio Level:</b> Data have a meaningful order, measurable differences, and a true zero
                        point, allowing for meaningful ratios. Examples include weight, height, or age.</p>

                <h2>Sampling Techniques</h2>
                <p>Sampling is used when gathering data from an entire population is impractical or too expensive. A
                    sample should represent the population's characteristics, and random sampling methods help
                    achieve this. Common random sampling techniques include:</p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <h2 class="definition-header">Common Sampling Techniques</h2>
                    <p><b>Simple Random Sampling:</b> Every individual in the population has an equal chance of
                        being selected, ensuring that all samples of the same size are equally likely.</p>
                    <p><b>Stratified Sampling:</b> Divide the population into groups (strata) and take a
                        proportionate random sample from each group. For instance, sample students from various
                        departments to represent a college population.</p>
                    <p><b>Cluster Sampling:</b> Divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some
                        clusters and include all members from those clusters in the sample. For example, randomly
                        select departments in a college and survey all their students.</p>
                    <p><b>Systematic Sampling:</b> Randomly select a starting point and pick every nth member from a
                        population list. For example, choose every 50th name in a phone book for a survey.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Non-random sampling, such as convenience sampling, selects readily available participants, which
                    can lead to biased results. An example of convenience sampling might be selecting the first 20
                    customers entering a coffee shop: this sample is not random and will likely be biased in some
                    way. Sampling errors (e.g., small sample sizes) and nonsampling errors (e.g., data entry
                    mistakes) can also affect results. Larger samples tend to reduce sampling error, but sampling
                    bias occurs if some members have unequal chances of selection.</p>
                <p>Critical evaluation of studies is essential. Issues to consider include representativeness,
                    sample size, undue influence, causality, and potential confounding factors.</p>
