    <h1>Shapes of Frequency Distributions</h1>
    <p>The shape of a frequency distribution is an important geometric property that we can determine
        from
        its histogram. While there is one shape that is the most important, we will discuss other shapes
        at
        various points during the course. Before diving into the different shapes, it is helpful to
        understand some important concepts related to distributions: the <strong>peak</strong> and
        <strong>tails</strong> of a distribution.
    </p>
    <h2>The Peak and Tails</h2>
    <!-- Div Definition-->
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What is the peak of a distribution?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>peak of a distribution</strong> refers to the tallest part of the histogram,
            which
            represents the class(es) with the most data. Distributions can have one peak
            (<strong>unimodal</strong>)

    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What are the tails of a distribution?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>tails of a distribution</strong> refer to the far ends of the distribution, which
            represent the extreme values of the dataset. For example, in a histogram, the left tail
            corresponds to the smallest values, while the right tail corresponds to the largest values.
            The
            shape and behavior of the tails can provide insights into the skewness and outliers of the
            distribution.</p>

    </div>
    <!-- End Div Definition-->
    <p>Now that we understand the tails and peaks of frequency distributions, let’s examine the
        different
        shapes these distributions can take.</p>
    <div class="notes-page-break"></div>
    <h2>Shapes of Distributions</h2>
    <!--Definition-->
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">What are the different shapes of frequency distributions?</h2>
        <p>There are three main shapes: <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>multimodal</strong>, and
            <strong>uniform</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Unimodal Distributions (single-peak)</h4>
        <p>Unimodal distributions have a single peak in their histogram. These distributions begin with
            small bars that gradually increase in height from left to right, reach a peak at one class,
            and
            then decrease from left to right. There are three subtypes of unimodal
            distributions:&nbsp;<strong>normal</strong>, <strong>skew-left</strong>, and
            <strong>skew-right</strong>.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Normal Distributions (aka bell-shaped distribution)</h5>
        <p>This is the most important distribution in the course. A <span class="blanked"><strong>normal
                    distribution</strong></span> is symmetric,
            with
            its peak located at the center. Its tails extend in both directions but gradually get closer
            and
            closer to the horizontal axis as they extend outward. The shape of the histogram for a
            normal
            distribution resembles a bell, hence the name "bell-shaped distribution."</p>
        <p><img class="img-centered" src="../images/normal2.png"
                alt="The red curve drawn over the histogram looks like a bell."
                title="The red curve drawn over the histogram looks like a bell." width="400"
                height="242">
        </p>
        <div class="notes-page-break"></div>
        <h5>Skew-Left Distributions</h5>
        <p>A skew-left distribution (also called negatively skewed) is a distribution where the left
            tail is
            longer than the right tail. In these distributions, the majority of the data values are
            concentrated toward the right side of the histogram, with fewer values on the left. This
            creates
            a tail that extends toward smaller values.</p>
        <p><img class="img-centered" src="../images/leftskew.png"
                alt="Distribution is left-skewed since the left tail is longer than the right tail."
                title="Distribution is left-skewed since the left tail is longer than the right tail."
                width="399" height="238"></p>
        <h5>Skew-Right Distributions</h5>
        <p>A skew-right distribution (also called positively skewed) is a distribution where the right
            tail
            is longer than the left tail. In these distributions, the majority of the data values are
            concentrated toward the left side of the histogram, with fewer values on the right. This
            creates
            a tail that extends toward larger values.</p>
        <p><img class="img-centered" src="../images/rightskew.png"
                alt="Distribution is right-skewed because its right tail is longer than its left tail."
                title="Distribution is right-skewed because its right tail is longer than its left tail."
                width="401" height="232"></p>
        <div class="notes-page-break"></div>
        <h4>Multimodal Distributions (multiple peaks)</h4>
        <p>Multimodal distributions have multiple peaks in their histogram. A <strong>bimodal
                distribution</strong> has two peaks, a <strong>trimodal distribution</strong> has three,
            and
            anything with four or more peaks is just called a <strong>multimodal distribution</strong>.
            While we won’t cover multimodal distributions in this course, you may encounter them in
            advanced
            statistics courses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img class="img-centered" src="../images/bimodal2.png"
                alt="A bimodal distribution with its two peaks labeled."
                title="A bimodal distribution with its two peaks labeled." width="400" height="249"></p>
        <h4>Uniform Distributions</h4>
        <p><span class="blanked"><strong>Uniform distributions</strong></span> have bars that area all
            approximately the same height (give or take a
            small
            margin of error).</p>
        <p><img class="img-centered" src="../images/uniform2.png"
                alt="Uniform distribution have bars that are all approximately the same height."
                title="Uniform distribution have bars that are all approximately the same height."
                width="399" height="260"></p>
        <h5>Homework Note</h5>
        <p>Homework problems will ask you to identify the shape of a distribution. The easiest way to
            determine the shape is by drawing or visualizing a curve through the tops of the bars, as
            shown
            in the examples above for unimodal and multimodal distributions.&nbsp; If the distribution
            is
            uniform, all the bars should be approximately the same height.</p>
