    <h1>Conducting Hypothesis Testing on Population Means and Proportions</h1>
    <p>In this section, we will bring together all the components introduced earlier to conduct hypothesis testing. Using sample data, we will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support or refute a claim about a population mean or proportion.</p>
    
    <h2>Using GeoGebra for Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p>As a reminder, we will use the GeoGebra applet for conducting hypothesis tests. This tool allows us to input sample data, specify null and alternative hypotheses, and calculate p-values.</p>

    <h2>Testing Claims about Population Proportions</h2>
    
    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Smoking Cessation with Nicotine Patch</h2>
        <p>A study examines whether nicotine patch therapy helps smokers quit. Among 71 smokers, 39 were still smoking one year after treatment, and 32 were not. Use a significance level of \( \alpha = 0.05 \) to test the claim that the majority (\( p > 0.5 \)) of smokers continue smoking after one year.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">
        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
        <p>Using GeoGebra, input the sample information (\( x = 39, n = 71, p_0 = 0.5 \), and alternative hypothesis \( p > 0.5 \)). The p-value is calculated to be \( 0.0403 \).</p>
        <p>Since \( p = 0.0403 < \alpha = 0.05 \), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the majority of smokers continue smoking after one year.</p>
