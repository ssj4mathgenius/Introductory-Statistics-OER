                    <p>
                        The main objective of this lesson is to develop a sound understanding of probability values
                        because these values constitute the underlying foundation for inferential statistics which will
                        be used later in the course. The primary way that statisticians think is by applying the "rare
                        event rule" when making inferences which says the following:
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is extremely
                            small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.

                        <p>Suppose a pharmaceutical company has developed a gender-selection drug that claims to
                            <em>greatly increase the chance of having a baby girl</em>. From 100 births using the drug,
                            it is found that 98 girls were born and 2 boys were born. Using the <em>rare event rule</em>
                            what would be the conclusion statisticians will make regarding this scenario in regard to
                            the drug's claim?

                        <p>Statisticians will <strong>reject</strong> the idea that “98 girls in 100 births happened by
                            chance” as an explanation because the probability of 98 girls in 100 births occurring by
                            chance is extremely small. Moreover, statisticians will view this experiment as evidence
                            supporting the claim that the drug is effective at increasing the chances of having a girl.

                    <h2>Basic Concepts of Probability</h2>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Event</h2>
                        <p>An event is any collection of results or outcomes of a procedure. For example: if the
                            procedure was “flipping a coin,” the possible events can be <strong>heads</strong> or
                            <strong>tails</strong>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Simple Event</h2>
                        <p>A simple event is an outcome of a procedure that cannot be further broken down into simpler
                            components. For example: if a coin is flipped twice, the four simple events (letting H be
                            "Head" and T being "Tail" as the side that lands faceup) would be HH, HT, TH, and TT. The
                            two events HT and TH are distinct since HT would represent getting a Head on the first flip
                            and a Tail on the second flip where TH represents getting a Tail first then a Head.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Sample Space</h2>
                        <p>The sample space for a procedure consists of all possible simple events. Often the sample
                            space will be written in curly braces such as { and }.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>A few of the introductory homework exercises will ask for the sample space for a particular
                        procedure. Understanding how to generate the sample space will be key for performing several
                        probability exercises. The main recommended strategy when creating a sample space is to maintain
                        a pattern when listing out all the possible outcomes for a procedure. Let's look at some
                        examples.</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Sample Space for Coin
                            Flips</h2>
                        <p>List the sample space for flipping a coin three times.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                        <p>If we start with all Heads (HHH) or all Tails (TTT) we can create a pattern where we slowly
                            introduce one new result. For instance, if we start with all Heads (which is the only way
                            that can happen) we would then move to 2 Heads and 1 Tails listing all the possible ways
                            that can happen. Then we would do all possible ways 1 Head and 2 Tails could happen. Then
                            lastly we would list all Tails (TTT) as the final simple event. Our resulting sample space
                            would be:</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample Space = { HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT }</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Sample Space for Four
                            Coin Flips</h2>
                        <p>List the sample space for flipping a coin four times.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                        <p>We would want to follow a similar pattern to the previous example: start with all H's or T's
                            then move to a 1-3 split, then a 2-2 split, then a 3-1 split, then finish with all H's or
                            T's whichever we didn't start with. We would get a samples space like the following:</p>
                        <p><strong>
                                Sample Space = { HHHH, HTHH, HHHT, HHTH, THHH, HHTT, HTHT, THTH, TTHH, HTTH, THHT, HTTT,
                                THTT,
                                TTHT, TTTH, TTTT }
                            </strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Notation for Probabilities</h2>
                    <p>Probabilities are denoted by \(P\). For instance, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) denote specific events,
                        and \(P(A)\) represents the probability of event \(A\) occurring. This notation is analogous to
                        function notation in algebra. For example, just as \(f(x)\) is read as “a function of \(x\),”
                        \(P(A)\) is read as “probability of \(A\).”</p>

                    <p>Often we may use a word phrase for the event \(A\) such as "Rain Today" so it isn't uncommon to
                        also see \(P(\text{Rain Today})\) which is understood to mean "the probability/chance of rain
                        today".</p>

                    <h2>How to Find Probability</h2>
                    <p>To find the probability of an event, calculate the ratio of the number of times the event can
                        happen to the total number of outcomes. That is, to find the probability of some event \( A \)
                        we perform the operation:
                        \[P(A) = \frac{\text{number of times event }A\text{ occurred}}{\text{total number of possible
                        outcomes}} \]</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Probability of Being
                            Bumped from a Flight
                        </h2>
                        <p>Among 15,378 Delta airline passengers randomly selected, 3 were bumped from a flight against
                            their wishes. Find the probability that a randomly selected passenger is involuntarily
                            bumped. Is such a bumping unlikely?</p>
                        <p>Note: <strong>"unlikely"</strong> meaning a 5% chance or less</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                        <p>If we let \(A =\) "Bumped from a Delta Flight", we can apply the formula and calculate the
                            probability with the following:</p>
                        <p>\( P(A)= \frac{\text{number of times bumped}}{\text{total number of passengers}} =
                            \dfrac{3}{15,378} = 0.000195.\)</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes for very small decimal values you may see technology output
                            these in scientific notation like \(1.95\times 10^{-4}\).</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Probability Limits</h2>
                    <p>Probabilities are always between 0 and 1 as well as include 0 and 1 themselves. Often you may see
                        these as percentages too: 0 would be 0% and 1 would be equivalent to 100%. Anything in this
                        range would be valid for a probability.</p>

                    <p>The probability of an impossible event is 0 or 0%,
                        while the probability of a certain event is 1 or 100%.</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Valid Probability
                            Values</h2>
                        <p>Which of the following values <strong>cannot</strong> represent a probability? \[\frac{3}{2},
                            -0.1, 1, 0.17, 0, \frac{2}{5}, \sqrt{2}\].</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                        <p>The values \(\frac{3}{2}\), \(\sqrt{2}\), and \(-0.1\) cannot represent probabilities because
                            they fall outside
                            the range of 0 to 1 The values of \(0.17\), 0, 1, and \(\frac{2}{5}\) are all between 0 and
                            1 meaning they can be probabilities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Probabilities Expressed as Percentages</h2>
                    <p>While a probability of 0.25 is mathematically equivalent to 25%, there are strong reasons to work
                        with fractions or decimals instead of percentages. Professional journals almost exclusively
                        express probabilities as decimals. Statistical software also outputs probabilities in decimal
                        form, which simplifies calculations. For instance, multiplying probabilities like \(0.25 \times
                        0.25\) is straightforward, whereas working with percentages like \(25\% \times 25\%\) can lead
                        to confusion.</p>

                    <h2>Law of Large Numbers</h2>
                    <p>When using the relative frequency approach to estimate probabilities, we obtain approximations
                        that improve as the total number of observations increases. This principle is described by the
                        <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>:
                    </p>

                    <div class="definition">
                        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Law of Large Numbers</h2>
                        <p>As a procedure is repeated multiple times, the relative frequency probability of an event
                            tends to approach its actual probability.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This law highlights that probability estimates become more accurate with a larger number of
                        trials. For instance, probabilities calculated from a few trials may vary significantly from the
                        true probability, but with many trials, the estimates stabilize.</p>

                    <h2>Cautions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Applicability to Large Numbers Only:</strong>
                            <p>The law of large numbers applies to repeated trials, not individual outcomes. A common
                                misconception among gamblers is the belief that a streak of losses increases the chances
                                of a win (or vice versa), leading to irrational decisions and significant losses.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Avoiding Unsupported Assumptions:</strong>
                            <p>If the likelihood of outcomes is unknown, we should not assume they are equally probable.
                                For example, assuming a 50% chance of passing a statistics test just because the outcome
                                is binary (pass or fail) ignores factors like preparation and test difficulty, which
                                heavily influence the actual probability.</p>
                        </li>

                        <p>The result of exactly 500 heads would be very <b>unlikely</b> since the probability of that
                            happening in the scenario is less than 5%. However, us getting exactly 500 heads in 1000
                            flips is <b>not an unusual</b> number of successes since we would normally expect about half
                            of the flips to be heads.</p>

                    <h2>Tables and Probability</h2>
                    <p>A lot of the problems we will be encountering in the homework have tables of all the possible
                        outcomes. Finding the probabilities can be tricky when reading some of these tables since the
                        tables must be read in multiple directions. See the example below as the introduction to reading
                        these tables.</p>
