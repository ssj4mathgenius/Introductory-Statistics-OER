                            <h3>What Are Mutually Exclusive Events?</h3>
                            <p>Two events are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> if they <strong>cannot happen at the
                                    same time</strong>. This means that if one event occurs, the other cannot.
                                Mathematically, two events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive if:</p>
                            <p>\[ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0 \]</p>
                            <p>or alternatively,</p>
                            <p>\[ A \text{ and } B = \emptyset \]</p>
                            <h4>Grammar Note</h4>
                            <p>In everyday English, the word "or" is usually <strong>inclusive</strong>. For example, if
                                someone says, "You can have cake or ice cream," they may mean that you can have either
                                one or both since these items are typically sold separately from a meal. However, "You
                                can choose soup or salad with your entrée" is mutually exclusive since the terms of the
                                meal means you can have one or another, but not both, without an additional charge.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>Addition Rule for Probability</strong> states that for any two events \( E \)
                                and \( F \) that the probability of \(E\) or \(F\) is equal to the probability of \(E\)
                                plus the probability of \(F\) minus the probability of both events occurring at the same
                                time.&nbsp; In symbols, we write this as \[ P(E \text{ or } F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E

                            <p>If \( E \) and \( F \) are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>, then the formula

                                both types of therapy, the answer in this case is yes!&nbsp; This means we have to use

                            <p>A <strong>two-way table</strong> (also called a <strong>contingency table</strong>) is a
                                way to organize data that involves two categorical variables. It helps us analyze
                                relationships between categories and compute probabilities.</p>
                            <p>A two-way table consists of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Individual Cells:</strong> Represent counts for specific category
                                    combinations, denoted as \( n(\text{Category 1 and Category 2}) \).</li>
                                <li><strong>Row Totals:</strong> Represent counts for each row category, denoted as \(
                                    n(\text{Category 1}) \).</li>
                                <li><strong>Column Totals:</strong> Represent counts for each column category, denoted
                                    as \( n(\text{Category 2}) \).</li>
                                <li><strong>Grand Total:</strong> The total number of individuals surveyed, denoted as
                                    \( n(\text{{Total}}) \).</li>
