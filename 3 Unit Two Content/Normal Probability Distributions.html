                    <section>
                        <h1>The Normal Distribution</h1>
                        <p>The normal distribution, a continuous probability distribution, is one of the most widely
                            used
                            and studied distributions. Its bell-shaped curve appears in various fields such as
                            psychology,
                            business, economics, and the sciences. Examples include IQ scores, real estate prices, and
                            more.
                            It is essential for inferential statistics and probability analysis.</p>
                        <p>The normal distribution is characterized by a symmetric, bell-shaped curve when plotted. It
                            is
                            defined by two parameters: the <span class="blanked"><strong>mean</strong></span> (\( \mu
                            \)) and the <span class="blanked"><strong>standard deviation</strong></span> (\( \sigma \)).
                            The
                            total area under the curve is <span class="blanked">equal to 1</span> making it a <b>density
                                curve</b> which sets up that
                            same connection between area and probability we observed with uniform distributions.</p>

                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The graph is symmetric around the mean (\(\mu\)), which is also the median and mode.
                            </li>
                            <li>It is defined by two parameters: the mean (\(\mu\)) and the standard deviation
                                (\(\sigma\)).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The density curve for the normal probability distribution is graphed by using the
                                    following formula:</p>
                                <p>\[
                                    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
                                    \right)^2}
                                    \]</p>
                                <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not necessary to memorize this formula.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Since it has a more complicated bell-shape, we will have to rely on technology to find
                                values associated with it.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Standard Normal Distribution</h2>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Standard Normal Distribution</h2>
                            <p>The <strong>standard normal distribution</strong> is a special case of the normal
                                distribution where the
                                <b>mean <span class="blanked">is 0</span></b> and <b>the standard deviation <span
                                        class="blanked">is 1</span></b>. Values in this distribution are
                                represented as z-scores.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Finding the area under the normal distribution is not quite as easy as it was for uniform
                            distributions so we will heavily be relying on technology to help us find the area under
                            these
                            more complicated bell-shapes. The following tool in GeoGebra can both be used to find
                            areas/probabilities as well as horizontal values ($z$-scores for standard normal
                            distributions
                            and $x$-values for non-standard normal distributions).</p>

                            enter our horizontal value(s) (denoted as $x$ or $z$ in the applet). Then we can choose one

                            "Tail Types":</p>
