    <h1>Addition Rule for Probability</h1>

    <h2>The Addition Rule for Probability "OR"</h2>
    <p>
        The addition rule calculates the probability that either event \(A\), event \(B\), or both
        occur. This rule is formally expressed as:
        \[
        P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B).
        \]
        This may seem a little hard to understand so we will break this down with an example below.
        The
        primary idea to focus on first is the key word in this section is "or," indicating that
        either
        event \(A\), event \(B\), or both
        can occur in a single trial. Let's look at an example of how we would find a compound
        probability (a probability where two or more events are involved) involving the word "OR".
    </p>

    <div class="example">

        <p>Refer to the table below and find the probability of getting a positive
            test result <b>OR</b> a subject who lied when one of the 85 test subjects is chosen.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p id="tableDescription" class="visually-hidden">This table summarizes the results of a
            polygraph test, showing counts
            for

        <div class="solution">

                <p>
                    If we want to solve this, we will simply count the number of subjects who tested
                    positive
                    <b>or</b> lied making sure that we do not count subjects <strong>twice</strong>.
                    If we are
                    applying the formal formula for finding \( P(A \text{ or }B) \) it would look
                    like the
                    following:
                    \[ P(\text{tested positive OR lied}) = P(\text{tested positive}) +
                    P(\text{lied}) -
                    P(\text{overlap of positive and lied})\]
                    which would reduce to
                    \[ P(\text{tested positive OR lied}) = \dfrac{12+37}{85} + \dfrac{37+6}{85} -
                    \dfrac{37}{85}=\dfrac{12+37+37+6-37}{85}=\dfrac{55}{85}\]
                    Sum the
                    relevant counts and then divide by the total number of subjects. We get:
                    \[
                    P(\text{tested positive or lied}) = \dfrac{12+37+6}{85}=\dfrac{55}{85} \approx
                    0.647.
                    \]
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>So we can see that to apply the addition rule we will be adding the probability of event A
        and
        the probability of event B and, if there is any overlap that causes double-counting,
        compensate
        for it by subtracting the probability of outcomes that are included twice. This approach is
        reflected in the above formal addition rule. However, it may be easier to consider this more
        intuitive approach documented below when working with these problems in this introductory
        course.</p>

    <h2>Disjoint Events and Complements</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever events \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, \(P(A \text{ and } B)\) becomes zero in the
        formal
        addition rule which happened for our previous problem.</p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Events \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if they cannot occur at the
            same time, meaning they do not overlap. For example, if we had these two events
        <ul>
            <li>Randomly selecting an inaccurate order from McDonald's</li>
            <li>Randomly selecting an accurate order from McDonald's</li>
        </ul>
        we would say these two events are disjoint since it is impossible to select an order that is
        both accurate and inaccurate.

                <p>Since a card cannot be both red and black at the same time, these two events have no overlap. That is, \( A \cap B = \emptyset \). Therefore, these events are disjoint.</p>

                <p>A card can be both a face card and a spade. For example, the King of Spades, Queen of Spades, and Jack of Spades are all in both event \( C \) and event \( D \). Since there is overlap, \( C \cap D \neq \emptyset \), meaning these events are not disjoint.</p>

        since there is no overlap to subtract. However, instead of blindly applying the formula, it is
        more effective to understand and intuitively apply the addition rule.

        <h2 class="definition-header">Key Points of the Addition Rule</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To find \(P(A \text{ or } B)\), associate the word "or" with addition.</li>
            <li>To calculate \(P(A \text{ or } B)\), add the number of ways \(A\) can occur and the
                number of ways \(B\) can occur, being careful to only count subjects <span

        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
        The most common way we will encounter disjoint events is when looking at an event's
        <b>complement</b>,
        which is denoted often with a "bar" over the event itself.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="example-header">Definition: Complement of an Event</h2>
        <p>
            For any event \( A \), it's <span class="blanked"><b>complement</b></span> \(
            \overline{A} \) is all outcomes in which
            event \( A \) does not occur. Common
            sense dictates the following principle: We are certain (with probability 1) that either
            an
            event
            \( A \) occurs or it does not occur. Thus, it follows that:
            \[P(A \text{ or } \overline{A}) = 1\]
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Because events \( A \) and \( \overline{A} \) must be disjoint, we can use the addition rule
        to
        express this principle as:
        \[P(A \text{ or } \overline{A}) = P(A) + P(\overline{A}) = 1\]
        This result of the addition rule leads to the following three equivalent expressions, which
        are just different forms of the same principle:

                    The complement of \(P(\text{rain today})\) is \(P(\text{no rain today})\), and
                    if we want to
                    find the \(P(\text{no rain today}) \) we could use the second formula above: \(
                    P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A) \). Writing \(P(\text{rain today})\) as a decimal we
                    know \(20\%
                    = 0.20\) giving us
                    \[
                    P(\text{no rain today}) = 1 - P(\text{rain today}) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \text{ or }
