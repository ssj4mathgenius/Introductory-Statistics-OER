    <h1>The Binomial Probability Distribution</h1>
    <p>A <strong>binomial probability distribution</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in
        statistics, representing scenarios where there are only two possible outcomes for each trial,
        such as success or failure. These distributions model real-world processes like flipping a coin,
        conducting quality control checks ("good unit" or "defective unit"), or measuring customer
        preferences ("yes" or "no").</p>
    <p>By studying binomial distributions, statisticians can predict probabilities of various outcomes
        and assess the likelihood of events over multiple trials. Often these results will be recorded
        with probability distribution tables which we will examine how to create in this section. Below
        we have the conditions to check for in order to ensure a scenario represents a binomial
        probability distribution:</p>

    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Binomial Probability Distributions</h2>
        <p>A binomial probability distribution results from a procedure that meets all the following
            requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The procedure has a fixed number of trials.</li>
            <li>The trials are independent (the outcome of any trial does not affect subsequent trials).
            </li>
            <li>The probability of success remains the same in all trials.</li>
            <li>Each trial has outcomes classified into <span class="blanked">two</span> categories: "success" and "failure."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Determining if a
            Procedure is Binomial</h2>
        <p>Determine if the given procedure results in a binomial distribution. If it isn’t binomial,
            identify the requirement that isn’t met:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Treating \(863\) subjects with Lipitor and recording whether they “yes” get a headache
                or “no” they didn't get a headache.</li>
            <li>Treating \(863\) subjects with Lipitor and asking them “How does your head feel?”</li>
        </ol>

            <ol class="list-a">
                <li>Yes, this is a binomial distribution because it satisfies all the requirements: 863
                    fixed number of trials, each person responding if they got a headache or not is
                    independent of others, the probability of "success" (or getting a headache) will be the
                    same in all trials since everyone used the same drug Lipitor, and there are two
                    categories of outcomes - "yes" or "no".</li>
                <li>No, this is not a binomial distribution. Similar to part (a) it meets most of the
                    qualifications to be binomial except for the condition where the outcomes are classified
                    into just two categories: recording an open-ended response like "how does your head
                    feel" opens the door for more than two outcomes or responses.</li>

    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Using Technology to Find Binomial Probabilities</h2>
        <p>Binomial probabilities can be found using technology (eg.,GeoGebra). All you need to do is
            identify these three variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\(n\): the total number of trials</li>
            <li>\(p\): the probability of <span class="blanked"><strong>success</strong></span> (or probability of the desired outcome), written as a
                decimal.</li>
            <li>\(x\): the number of successes desired, which must be a whole number up to and including
                \(n\). This value cannot exceed \(n\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have these values, you can plug them into GeoGebra to find the probability of \(x\) success.
        </p>
        <figure><img class="img-centered responsive-img" src="../images/binomGeoGebraApp.jpg" alt="Image showing the GeoGebra Binomial Distribution Calculator"
            aria-describedby="GeoGebraCaptionforBinomialDistribution1">
            <figcaption id="GeoGebraCaptionforBinomialDistribution1" class="visually-hidden">
                The GeoGebra binomial distribution calculator is pictured with \(n\) set to 20 and \(p\) set ot 0.50. The "problem type" shows a dropdown menu with all 5 selections visible to choose from. A statement at the bottom \(P(X=9)=0.1602\) is shown with the value \(9\) being the entered number.
            </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You simply enter a value for \(n\) first \(p\). Then you can choose your "problem type" depending on what is required. Lastly, enter your \(x\) value for the number of successes desired. Then the resulting probability will be automatically calculated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="caution">
        <h2 class="caution-header">"Success" and "Failure"</h2>
        <p>When speaking about "success", we are not necessarily meaning an outcome that is "good". The
            term "success" is just an arbitrary term used for the desired outcome or the outcome we are
            testing claims about or estimating in later sections. So for instance if we are flipping
            coins and we assign \(x\) as the number of heads then "success" for us would be <b>heads</b>
            meaning that "failure" would be <b>tails</b>.</p>

                    \[

                    \(x=0\) is below \(1.3\), so it is a significantly low number of people knowing Wendy’s.

        <p>For a binomial probability distribution, the mean and standard deviation can be found using
            the following formulas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\(\mu = n \cdot p\)</li>
            <li>\(\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}\)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These formulas provide a quick and efficient way to calculate these values without requiring
            detailed computations.</p>

                    <p>This scenario represents a binomial distribution because it satisfies the following
                        conditions: there is a fixed number of trials (\(n=100\)), each question represents
                        an independent trial, there are only two outcomes per trial (correct or incorrect),
                        and the probability of success (\(p=0.2\)) remains constant for each trial.</p>
                    <p> \(n = 100\), \(p = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2\).
                        Mean: \(\mu = n \cdot p = 100 \cdot 0.2 = 20\).
                        Standard deviation: \(\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1-p)} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 0.2
                        \cdot 0.8} = \sqrt{16} = 4\).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Significant values are outside the range \(\mu - 2\sigma\) to \(\mu + 2\sigma\):
                        \[
                        \mu - 2\sigma = 20 - 2(4) = 12, \quad \mu + 2\sigma = 20 + 2(4) = 28
                        \]
                        \(60\) is far above \(28\), making it a significantly high number of correct
                        answers. This result would likely not occur by random guessing.
