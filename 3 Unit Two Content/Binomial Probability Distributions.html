    <h1>The Binomial Probability Distribution</h1>
    <p>A <strong>binomial probability distribution</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in statistics, representing scenarios where there are only two possible outcomes for each trial, such as success or failure. These distributions model real-world processes like flipping a coin, conducting quality control checks ("good unit" or "defective unit"), or measuring customer preferences ("yes" or "no").</p>
<p>By studying binomial distributions, statisticians can predict probabilities of various outcomes and assess the likelihood of events over multiple trials. Often these results will be recorded with probability distribution tables which we will examine how to create in this section. Below we have the conditions to check for in order to ensure a scenario represents a binomial probability distribution:</p>

    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Binomial Probability Distributions</h2>
        <p>A binomial probability distribution results from a procedure that meets all the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The procedure has a fixed number of trials.</li>
            <li>The trials are independent (the outcome of any trial does not affect subsequent trials).</li>
            <li>The probability of success remains the same in all trials.</li>
            <li>Each trial has outcomes classified into two categories: "success" and "failure."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="caution"><h2 class="caution-header">"Success" and "Failure"</h2>
    <p>When speaking about "success", we are not necessarily meaning an outcome that is "good". The term "success" is just an arbitrary term used for the desired outcome or the outcome we are testing claims about or estimating in later sections. So for instance if we are flipping coins and we assign \(x\) as the number of heads then "success" for us would be <b>heads</b> meaning that "failure" would be <b>tails</b>.</p></div>

    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Determining if a Procedure is Binomial</h2>
        <p>Determine if the given procedure results in a binomial distribution. If it isn’t binomial, identify the requirement that isn’t met:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Treating \(863\) subjects with Lipitor and recording whether they “yes” get a headache or “no” they didn't get a headache.</li>
            <li>Treating \(863\) subjects with Lipitor and asking them “How does your head feel?”</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
        <ol class="list-a">
            <li>Yes, this is a binomial distribution because it satisfies all the requirements: 863 fixed number of trials, each person responding if they got a headache or not is independent of others, the probability of "success" (or getting a headache) will be the same in all trials since everyone used the same drug Lipitor, and there are two categories of outcomes - "yes" or "no".</li>
            <li>No, this is not a binomial distribution. Similar to part (a) it meets most of the qualifications to be binomial except for the condition where the outcomes are classified into just two categories: recording an open-ended response like "how does your head feel" opens the door for more than two outcomes or responses.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>    

    <div class="definition">
        <h2 class="definition-header">Using Technology to Find Binomial Probabilities</h2>
        <p>Binomial probabilities can be found using technology (eg.,GeoGebra). All you need to do is identify these three variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\(n\): the total number of trials</li>
            <li>\(p\): the probability of success (or probability of the desired outcome), written as a decimal.</li>
            <li>\(x\): the number of successes desired, which must be a whole number up to and including \(n\), but cannot exceed \(n\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have these values, plug them into GeoGebra to find the probability of \(x\) success.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: Finding Binomial Probabilities</h2>

            <li>
                Using technology to calculate \(P(x \geq 2)\) with \(n=5\) and \(p=0.6\), we find:
                \[
                P(x \geq 2) = 0.9130

        <h2 class="example-header">Example <span class="example-number"></span>: How Binomial Probabilities are Found</h2>
        <p>Multiple choice questions on Professor Smith's second exam have 6 possible answers (a, b, c, d, e, f). Let “C” represent getting a question right and “W” represent getting one wrong. Assume there are 3 such questions on this exam (\(n=3\)). Answer the questions below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the multiplication rule to find the probability of getting the first one correct, the second one wrong, and the last one correct. In other words, find \(P(CWC)\).</li>
            <li>Find the probabilities of \(WCC\) and \(CCW\). Then, combine these with \(CWC\) to get the probability of “getting exactly two questions correct.”</li>
            <li>For this problem, confirm this is a binomial situation. Then identify \(n\),\(x\), and \(p\) for the scenario of getting "exactly two questions correct".</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Each question has a \(1/6\) probability of being correct and a \(5/6\) probability of being wrong:
                \[
                P(CWC) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{216} \approx 0.0231
                \]
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly calculate \(P(WCC)\) and \(P(CCW)\):
                \[
                P(WCC) = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{216}
                \]
                \[
                P(CCW) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{5}{216}
                \]
                Combine the probabilities:
                \[
                P(\text{exactly 2 correct}) = P(CWC) + P(WCC) + P(CCW) = \frac{5}{216} + \frac{5}{216} + \frac{5}{216} = \frac{15}{216} = 0.0694
                \]
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This is a binomial situation because:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are a fixed number of trials (\(n=3\)), representing the 3 questions.</li>
                        <li>Each trial has only two possible outcomes: correct (\(C\)) or wrong (\(W\)).</li>
                        <li>The probability of success (\(p\)) remains constant at \(1/6\) for each question.</li>
                        <li>The trials are independent, as the outcome of one question does not affect the others.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For the scenario of getting "exactly two questions correct," the parameters are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(n = 3\) (number of trials)</li>
                        <li>\(x = 2\) (number of successes)</li>
                        <li>\(p = 1/6\) (probability of success on each trial)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using technology to find this binomial probability we get 0.0694 which is the same value we got above finding all the different combinations of getting "two correct answers"</p>
                    <p>While in this example it isn't difficult to find all the possible combinations of getting "two correct answers" to perform this calculation using the multiplication rule, imagine having a larger number of trials which would significantly increase the combinations of "two successes". This is why it is best to use technology to find these binomial probabilities.</p>
