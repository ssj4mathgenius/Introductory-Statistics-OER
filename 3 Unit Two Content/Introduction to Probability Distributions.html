                        <h1>Introduction to Probability Distributions</h1>

                        <p>Probability distributions describe what will theoretically happen instead of what actually
                            happened. They serve as theoretical models and when working with them we will use a
                            different
                            symbol for the mean and the standard deviation. When working with sample information we used
                            \(
                            \bar{x}\) for the mean and \( s \) for the standard deviation, but for probability
                            distributions
                            we will use the population mean (represented by \( \mu \)) and standard deviation
                            (represented
                            by \(\sigma\)) symbols.</p>

                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Random Variable</h2>
                            <p>A random variable is a variable (typically represented by the variable \(X\)) that has a
                                single numerical value, determined by chance, for each outcome of a procedure.</p>
                        </div>


                        <p>Below are some examples of a random variable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of eggs that a hen lays in a day: each day is different so this could be 0,
                                1,
                                etc (making it a <b>discrete random variable</b>)</li>
                            <li>The amount of milk a cow produces in one day: this could be 2 pts, 1.2 liters, etc each
                                day
                                (making it a <b>continuous random variable</b>)</li>
                            <li>The number of movies currently playing in U.S. theaters (another <b>discrete random
                                    variable</b> since movies are countable objects)</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>A discrete random variable has either a finite number of values or a countable number of
                                values, where “countable” refers to the fact that there might be infinitely many values,
                                but
                                they can be associated with a counting process, so that the number of values is \(0, 1,
                                2,
                                3, \dots\).</p>

                        <p>From this point forward we will mostly be focusing on discrete random variables in this
                            section
                            as we cover <b>probability distributions</b> and, later, <b>binomial distributions</b>, but
                            in
                            future sections we will cover distributions that are continuous (such as the Uniform and
                            Normal
                            distributions).</p>

                        <h2>Probability Distributions</h2>

                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Probability Distribution</h2>
                            <p>A <b>probability distribution</b> is a distribution that gives the probability for each
                                value
                                of the random variable. It is often expressed in the format of a graph, table, or
                                formula.
                                Many times \(x\) will be used for the various values of the random variable and \(P(x)\)
                                will represent the probabilities for obtaining \(x\) number of outcomes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p> A visual representation can often enhance our understanding of what a probability
                            distribution
                            entails. In essence, a probability distribution (in a table format) shares similarities with
                            a
                            frequency distribution mentioned in previous sections, but with a key difference: instead of
                            counting occurrences, it provides the likelihood of various outcomes. For example, consider
                            the
                            probability distribution shown below for the number of green peas in an experiment involving
                            5
                            peas. The left column represents the possible values of \(𝑥 \), the number of green peas,
                            while
                            the right column indicates the corresponding probabilities \(P(x)\) (or percentage chances)
                            of
                            each outcome. This structured layout offers a clear and concise way to visualize and
                            interpret
                            the chances associated with different numbers of green peas in the experiment.</p>

                            number of peas with green pods. The probabilities are listed in the second column.
                        </p>

                        <p> Probability distributions can be very helpful since they list out all possible outcomes
                            meaning
                            we will not have to calculate individual probabilities like the previous sections. For
                            instance,
                            if we wanted to know the "probability of getting exactly <b>two</b> green peas in an
                            experiment
                            with 5" then we know from the table this probability would be <b>0.088</b> or <b>8.8%</b>.
                            Similarly, if we wanted to know the "probability of getting <b>2 or fewer</b> peas with
                            green"
                            then we would know to add 0.088, 0.015, and 0.001 to get the sum of <b>0.104</b> or <b>10.4%
                                chance to get 2 or fewer green peas</b>.</p>
