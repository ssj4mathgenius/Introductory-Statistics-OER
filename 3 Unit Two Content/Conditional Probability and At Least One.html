                    <h2>The Probability of “At Least One”</h2>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "at least one" is equivalent to "one or more". That is to so, "1 or 2 or 3 or ...".
                        When looking at it in terms of numbers, it is easy to see that "0" is missing, and this would be
                        the complement of "at least one": the complement of "at least one" is that we get "none" of some
                        particular desired outcome.
                    </p>

                            Let's write the complements of the given statements using the phrase <b>"at least one"</b>.
                            Remember: "at least one" and "none" are complements so often we can just replace those
                            phrases to have the complement:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Given Statement: "Probability that None of the Flips are Heads" <br>
                                    Complement: "Probability that <b>At Least One</b> of the Flips is a Head".
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Given Statement: "Probability that All the Chosen Units are Good" <br>
                                    A strategy we could implement is to attempt to re-write the given statement so it
                                    has the phrase "none" in it. If we can do that, we will simply swap the phrase
                                    "none" out with "at least one" to have the complement. If we think about the
                                    original statement, "all good" is really the same as saying "none of the units are
                                    defective". So we can re-write the given statement to be <b>"Probability that none
                                        of the chosen units are defective"</b>. Then we can get the solution as follows:
                                    <br>
                                    Complement: "Probability that <b>At Least One</b> of the Chosen Units are defective"
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="caution">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Caution:</strong> A common mistake when dealing with complements is assuming that
                            the complement of "none" is "all".
                            For example, the complement of "none of the flips are heads" is not "all of the flips are
                            heads". Instead, the correct complement
                            is "at least one of the flips is a head". Always ensure that complements cover all
                            possibilities not included in the original event.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>So if we remember, one of the formulas for probabilities involving complements from the previous
                        sections was
                        \[ P(A) = 1 - P(\overline{A}) \]
                        So to calculate the probability of "at least one," we will let \(A=\text{"at least one"}\) and
                        \(\overline{A}=\text{"none"}\) and use the following formula:
                        \[
                        P(\text{At Least One}) = 1 - P(\text{None}).
                        \]
                        The reasoning behind this formula is that it is much easier to calculate 0 (None) of some
                        occurrence than calculating the ways that 1 or 2 or 3 or etc events can occur.</p>

                    <p>Let’s justify the reasoning with an example:</p>

                            Use two methods for finding the "probability of getting at least one tail" when flipping a
                            coin three times. First, list out the sample space to find this probability. Then, for the
                            second method, use the formula
                            \[
                            P(\text{At Least One}) = 1 - P(\text{None}).
                            \]
                            to find the "probability of getting at least one tail".

                            To find the "probability of getting at least one tail" when flipping a coin three times, we
                            will use two methods.
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Method 1: Listing the Sample Space</strong><br>
                                    The sample space for flipping a coin three times is as follows:
                                    \[ \text{Sample Space} = \{HHH, HHT, THH, HTH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\} \]
                                    Out of these 8 possible outcomes, 7 contain at least one tail (HHT, HTH, HTT, THH,
                                    THT, TTH, TTT). Thus, the probability of getting at least one tail is:
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{At Least One Tail}) = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total
                                    Outcomes}} = \frac{7}{8}
                                    \]
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Method 2: Using the Complement Formula</strong><br>
                                    The complement of "getting at least one tail" is "getting no tails," which means all
                                    the flips must be heads. There is only one outcome in the sample space where this
                                    happens: {HHH}. Thus, the probability of getting no tails is:
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{None of the flips are Tails}) = \frac{\text{Number of Outcomes with No
                                    Tails}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{1}{8}
                                    \]
                                    We could have also used the "multiplication rule" to compute this probability as
                                    well if we didn't have the sample space like this:
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{None of the flips are Tails}) = P(\text{1st not tails & 2nd not tails & 3rd
                                    not tails})
                                    \]
                                    And since the probability of not getting a tail on any flip of a standard coin is
                                    \(\cfrac{1}{2}\) we have the calculation as
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{None of the flips are Tails}) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot
                                    \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
                                    \]
                                    Finally, using the complement formula we get the probability of "at least one tail":
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{At Least One Tail}) = 1 - P(\text{None}) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
                                    \]
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> This example highlights how using the complement is often easier.
                            Calculating "at least one tail" directly requires counting 7 outcomes, while calculating "no
                            tails" requires identifying just 1 outcome. While this problem wasn't as complicated to list
                            out all possibilities, imagine doing a problem with 100 coin flips where there is no way to
                            list ALL the possible outcomes. It will be easier for us to use the formula going forward to
                            compute the "probability of at least one" since it only counts the one occurrence of "none".

                        <p>
                            The FICO (Fair Isaac & Company) score is a common credit rating. Among consumers with a FICO
                            score above 800, the delinquency rate is 1%. If four consumers with FICO scores above 800
                            are selected, find the probability that at least one becomes delinquent.

                        <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            If the delinquency rate is 1%, then the probability of a consumer "not being delinquent" is
                            99% or \( 0.99 \).
                            So to find the probability that at least one of the four selected consumers becomes
                            delinquent, we use the complement formula:
                            \[
                            P(\text{At Least One}) = 1 - P(\text{None})
                            \]
                            where \( P(\text{None}) \) is the probability that none of the four consumers becomes
                            delinquent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The probability of "not being delinquent" for one consumer is \( 0.99 \). If all four
                            consumers are not delinquent, the combined probability is:
                            \[
                            P(\text{None})=P(\text{1st not delinquent & 2nd not delinquent & 3rd not delinquent & 4th
                            not delinquent})
                            \]
                            Making the assumption that 4 people chosen out of all the people with credit ratings above
                            800 is less than 5%, we can apply the multiplication rule assuming the events are
                            "independent". We ge
                            \[
                            P(\text{none})=0.99 \cdot 0.99 \cdot 0.99 \cdot 0.99 = 0.99^4
                            \]
                            Calculating \( 0.99^4 \):
                            \[
                            P(\text{None}) = 0.960596
                            \]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, using the complement formula:
                            \[
                            P(\text{At Least One}) = 1 - P(\text{None}) = 1 - 0.960596 = 0.039404
                            \]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, the probability that at least one of the four selected consumers becomes delinquent is
                            approximately \( 0.0394 \) or \( 3.94\% \).

                            backup components. This is often the reason why many people have back-up alarm clocks to
                            ensure they wake up. To observe this, consider an alarm clock with a 0.86 probability of
                            working on any given morning. Use this to find the following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>What is the probability of the clock not working on any given morning?</li>
                            <li>If we had two such clocks, what would be the probability of them not working on any
                                given morning?</li>
                            <li>With two of these alarm clocks, what would be the chance of waking up on any given
                                morning?</li>
                            <li>Does overall system reliability improve with the second alarm clock?</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>

                                The probability of the clock working is \( P(\text{working}) = 0.86 \). Therefore, the
                                probability of the clock not working is:
                                \[
                                P(\text{not working}) = 1 - P(\text{working}) = 1 - 0.86 = 0.14

                                If we have two clocks, the events are assumed to be independent. The probability of both
                                clocks not working is the product of their individual probabilities:
                                \[
                                P(\text{both not working}) = P(\text{not working}) \times P(\text{not working}) = 0.14
                                \times 0.14 = 0.0196
                                \]

                                <strong>Chance of waking up (at least one clock works):</strong><br>
                                The event of "waking up" corresponds to "at least one clock works." Using the complement
                                formula for at least one:
                                \[
                                P(\text{at least one works}) = 1 - P(\text{none work})
                                \]
                                From part (b), we know \( P(\text{none work}) = 0.0196 \). Thus:
                                \[
                                P(\text{at least one works}) = 1 - 0.0196 = 0.9804
                                \]
                                Therefore, the chance of waking up is approximately \( 0.9804 \) or \( 98.04\% \).

                                By adding a second clock, the probability of waking up improves significantly from \(
                                86\% \) (with one clock) to \( 98.04\% \) (with two clocks). This demonstrates the

                    <p>
                        Conditional probability considers the likelihood of an event given additional knowledge that
                        another event has occurred. For instance, the probability of a golfer making a hole-in-one is \(
                        1/12,500 \), but if the golfer is a professional, the probability improves to \( 1/2,500 \).

                        <p>
                            A conditional probability of an event is a probability obtained with the additional
                            information that some other event occurred.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Notation:</strong> Often we see conditional probability written in the form \( P(B|A) \)
                        which represents "the probability of event \( B \) occurring, given that event \( A \) has
                        already occurred". While there is a formula for finding conditional probabilities, the easiest
                        way often to calculate this is found by using the intuitive approach.

                        <p>
                            The conditional probability of \( B \) occurring, given \( A \), can be calculated by
                            assuming \( A \) occurred and determining the likelihood of \( B \) occurring under this
                            condition.

                    <p>By assuming event \(A\) already occurred, this restricts your sample space greatly. We can see

                            To solve each part, we use the concept of conditional probability. By "assuming" the given
                            part already happened, we reduce the total sample space, meaning the denominator of the
                            probability will differ from the total in the entire table.

                                The entire table has 85 result, but by assuming the subject didn’t lie, we focus only on
                                the column labeled "No (Did Not Lie)". The total for this column is:
                                \[
                                12 + 30 = 42
                                \]
                                Now from this new total, we can find the number of negative tests (which is 30).
                                Therefor, we get negative test given the subject didn’t lie is:
                                \[
                                P(\text{Negative Test | Did Not Lie}) = \frac{30}{42} \approx 0.714
                                \]
                            </li>

                                Assuming the subject lied, we focus only on the column labeled "Yes (Lied)". The total
                                for this column is:
                                \[
                                37 + 6 = 43
                                \]
                                Since these are the only two values that matter now, we can look to see how many had a
                                positive test result of these 43 which is 37. So we get the probability of a positive
                                test given the subject lied to be
                                \[
                                P(\text{Positive Test | Lied}) = \frac{37}{43} \approx 0.860

                                Assuming the subject had a positive test, we focus only on the row labeled "Positive
                                Test Result". The total for this row is:
                                \[

                                Of these 49 people, we can see that 37 of them lied. So the probability of the subject
                                lying given the subject had a positive test is:
                                \[
