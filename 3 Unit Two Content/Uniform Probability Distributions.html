                        <h1>Continuous Probability Distributions</h1>
                        <p>Continuous probability distributions describe the likelihood of a random variable taking on a
                            value within a continuous range without gaps or interruptions. Continuous random variables
                            have
                            numerous applications across various fields. For example, they are used to model baseball
                            batting averages, IQ scores, the duration of long-distance telephone calls, the lifespan of
                            a
                            computer chip, rates of return on investments, and SAT scores. Other examples include daily
                            temperatures in a city, blood pressure readings, fuel efficiency of vehicles, reaction times
                            in
                            psychological tests, and time between arrivals of customers at a service center.</p>

                        <p>The field of reliability engineering relies heavily on continuous random variables to predict
                            the
                            longevity of products and systems, such as the time until failure of machinery or electronic
                            components. Similarly, risk analysis across industries like finance, insurance, and
                            environmental science depends on modeling continuous variables, such as stock market
                            volatility,
                            claim amounts in insurance policies, and river water levels during floods. These variables
                            help
                            professionals make informed decisions and manage uncertainty in real-world scenarios. This
                            lesson focuses on two key continuous probability distributions: the uniform distribution and
                            the
                            normal distribution. These distributions are fundamental in statistical analysis later in
                            the
                            course (especially the normal distribution) so we must have a good understanding of how to
                            work
                            with each one.</p>

                        <h2>The Uniform Distribution</h2>
                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Uniform Distribution</h2>
                            <p>A random variable has a <span class="blanked"><strong>uniform
                                        distribution</strong></span> if its values are spread evenly over the
                                range
                                of possibilities. The graph of a uniform distribution results in a rectangular (i.e.
                                box)
                                shape, where the total area under the curve is <span class="blanked">equal to 1</span>.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>In this lesson, we will explore how to calculate probabilities for uniform distributions.
                            Uniform
                            distributions are represented by a rectangular shape, where the total area under the curve
                            equals 1 (or 100%). This establishes a direct relationship between <span
                                class="blanked">probability</span> and area. To
                            find
                            probabilities for uniform distributions, we calculate the area of the corresponding section
                            of
                            the rectangle, which is determined by the formula for area: length multiplied by width.
                            Let’s
                            apply this concept with some examples below.</p>

                                and

                                            123 to 123.5 is shaded.

                                    <p>Now all we would need to do is find the area of this shaded region. Using a
                                        length of 0.7
                                        and
                                        a width of 0.5, we know the total area of this highlighted piece from 123 volts
                                        to 123.7
                                        volts would be \(0.7*0.5 = 0.35\). Since the area under the entire shape is
                                        equal to 1,
                                        this
                                        tells us that the probability is approximately 0.35 or <b>35% chance to select a
                                            voltage

                        <h2>Density Curves</h2>

                        <p>This previous example introduced us to a graph of a <b>density curve</b>, which you will be
                            seeing more and more of throughout the rest of this chapter.</p>

                        <div class="definition">
                            <h2 class="definition-header">Definition: Density Curve</h2>
                            <p>A <strong>density curve</strong> (also known as a <strong>probability density
                                    function</strong> or PDF) is a graph that represents the probability distribution of
                                a
                                continuous random variable. It shows how probabilities are distributed over the range of
                                possible values. Key properties of a density curve include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The total area under the curve is <span class="blanked">always 1</span>.</li>
                                <li>Probabilities correspond to areas under the curve between two points.</li>
                                <li>The curve lies entirely above the x-axis.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>When the graph of a continuous probability distribution (such as the rectangular "box" in the
                            previous example) is drawn these are what are called <strong>density curves</strong> (or
                            probability density functions, abbreviated as PDFs). Density curves always represent
                            probabilities as areas under the curve. The total area under the curve is always equal to 1
                            for
                            any density curve (this is true for both the uniform distribution observed in this section
                            but
                            also for the normal distributions we will see in the next section), indicating 100%

                            over all possible outcomes. For continuous random variables, the probability of any specific
                            value is 0 which is in contrast to discrete probability distributions seen in previous
                            sections,
                            as probabilities are calculated over intervals, not individual points.</p>

                        <h3>Key Features of a Density Curve:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The outcomes are measured, not counted.</li>
                            <li>Probability is the area under the curve for a range of \(x\)-values.</li>
                            <li>The total area under the density curve equals 1.</li>
                            <li>\(P(c < x < d)\) represents the probability that \(x\) falls between \(c\) and
                                    \(d\).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Since the area under each of these density curves is equal to 1, this gives us our connection
                            between area and probability meaning we can calculate probabilities using geometry,
                            formulas,
                            technology, or probability tables. Let's look at one more example of the uniform
                            distribution
                            before moving onto normal distributions. </p>

                                        <li>Mean: \(\mu = \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{447 + 521}{2} = 484\)</li>
                                        <li>Standard deviation: \(\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(b - a)^2}{12}} =
                                            \sqrt{\frac{(521 -
                                            447)^2}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{74^2}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{5476}{12}} \approx
                                            21.4\)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>3. The probability that the total duration is between 480 and 500 hours can be
                                        found in a
                                        similar way to the previous problem since we know the width of the uniform
                                        distribution
                                        will
                                        be \(\frac{1}{74}\). This gives us
                                        \[ A=L*W=(500-480)*\cfrac{1}{74} \approx 0.27 \]</p>
                                    <p>So we see that the probability of games lasting between 480 hours and 500 hours
                                        for a
                                        particular team is approximately 0.27, or 27%.</p>
