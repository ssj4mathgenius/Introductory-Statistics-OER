                        <h2>Multiplication Rule for Probability</h2>
                        <p>
                            The multiplication rule is used to find \(P(A \text{ and } B)\), the probability that event
                            \(A\) occurs in one trial and event \(B\) occurs in the next trial. To build towards a
                            formula
                            and (more importantly) an intuitive way to approach these problems, we will look at a couple
                            of
                            examples.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                There are two problems on a quiz. The first problem is a True or False question, and the
                                second question is a multiple-choice question with five possible answers (\(a, b, c, d,
                                e\)).
                                Find the probability that if someone makes random guesses for both answers, the first
                                answer
                                will be correct <strong>AND</strong> the second answer will be correct.

                                        of all
                                        combinations of a correct or incorrect answer for the True/False question and

                                        To calculate \( P(\text{both questions correct}) \), count the number of
                                        outcomes where the
                                        True/False question is correct (T) and the multiple-choice question is correct
                                        (e.g.,
                                        choosing the correct option out of \(a, b, c, d, e\)). Since there is only one
                                        of the 10
                                        different options that has <b>both questions correct</b>, we get the answer of
                                        \[P(\text{both questions correct}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 = 10\% \]
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Solution (Using Multiplication):</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Alternatively, we calculate \(P(\text{both questions correct})\) by finding the
                                        probability
                                        that the True/False question is correct and multiplying it by the probability
                                        that the
                                        multiple-choice question is correct:
                                        \[ P(\text{both questions correct}) = P(\text{T/F correct AND multiple-choice
                                        correct}) \]
                                        Which leads to the following since these two events are <b>independent</b>
                                        \[ P(\text{T/F correct AND multiple-choice correct}) = P(\text{T/F correct})
                                        \cdot
                                        P(\text{multiple-choice correct}) \]
                                        Now we just need the probability of each event first then we can perform the
                                        multiplication.
                                        For each event we see that
                                        \[P(\text{T/F correct}) = \frac{1}{2} \]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>(since there are 2 options: True or False, and 1 is correct) and </p>
                                    <p>\[ P(\text{multiple-choice correct}) = \frac{1}{5}\]
                                        (since there are 5 choices, and 1 is correct).</p>
                                    <p>Once we do the multiplication we see we get the same result as when we listed out
                                        the entire
                                        sample space.
                                        \[ P(\text{both questions correct}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} =
                                        \frac{1}{10} \]
                                        While the sample space for this particular problem wasn't difficult to list
                                        (there were only
                                        10 options), it will be more beneficial moving forward to try to implement this
                                        multiplication method presented here for finding probabilities of <b>"AND"</b>
                                        scenarios
                                        where there are multiple trials since listing the sample space can be very
                                        tedious for many
                                        problems.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            So it does seem that when we are working with probabilities involving the word <b>"AND"</b>
                            that
                            we can just multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So we get
                            \[
                            P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B).
                            \]
                            However, before accepting this as our final formula, we need to observe another type of
                            problem...

                                        There are \(30 + 6 = 36\) people with type O blood out of 100 total people.<br>

                                        Therefore, the probability that the first selected person has type O blood and

                                        has type A blood is approximately <b>0.1564</b>.

                        <p>This last problem had one aspect in it that wasn't present in the problem with the two quiz
                            questions: when we calculated the probability of the second event, we had to <b>adjust the
                                total</b> for the second event based on the fact that we already made a selection. When
                            this
                            happens, these events are said to be <b>dependent</b> since the probability of the

                            events will be adjusted based on the previous selections/outcomes. The finally leads us to
                            the
                            official "Multiplication Rule" for dealing with these "AND" probability problems.</p>

                                    Since there are 400 units with 8 being bad, we know that there are 392 units that are
                                    good
                                    to choose from. Then, for the first unit, the probability of being good is
                                    \(\dfrac{392}{400}\). If the first unit
                                    is good, the probability the second is good is \(\dfrac{391}{399}\). Notice we
                                    subtracted 1
                                    from both the numerator and denominator.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We subtracted 1 from the numerator since there is one less good one to choose from
                                        because of the first selection of a good one in the first trial.</li>
                                    <li>We subtracted 1 from the denominator since there is one less total to choose since
                                        we
                                        selected a unit in the first trial.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> Thus we calculate the probability of getting two good ones by multiplying the two
                                    probabilities:
                                </p>

                                    \]

                        <h2>Application of the 5% Guideline</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some calculations are cumbersome (imagine doing the previous problem selecting <strong>10 units</strong>),
                             but they can be made manageable by using the common practice of
                            treating events as <strong>independent</strong> when <span class="blanked"><strong>small 
                                samples</strong></span> are drawn from large
                            populations. In such cases, it is rare to select the same item <span class="blanked">twice</span>. To verify if you can
                            do this method, check if the sample size is no more than <span class="blanked"><strong>5%</strong></span> of the size of the
                            population. If you find the sample size is less than 5%, you can treat the selections as
                            being <strong>independent</strong> (i.e., with replacement). Why do we do this? It makes
                            calculations much simpler when events are independent. See the next example:
                        </p>

                        <div class="example">

                            <p>A factory produces 10,000 light bulbs daily, 500 of which are defective. If a quality
                                inspector randomly selects 20 bulbs for inspection, what is the probability that all 20
                                bulbs are good, assuming the 5% guideline (small samples from large populations allow
                                events
                                to be treated as independent)?</p>

                            <h2 class="solution-header">Solution</h2>
                            <div class="inches" data-height="2in"></div>
                            <div class="dontprint">
                                <p>
                                    The probability of selecting a good bulb on the first draw is \(P(\text{1st good}) =
                                    \dfrac{9500}{10000}\). If we continued in this manner, we would get \(P(\text{2nd good})
                                    =
                                    \dfrac{9499}{9999}\) and \(P(\text{3rd good}) =
                                    \dfrac{9498}{9998}\) and so on. This would be a very messy calculation so is there a
                                    better
                                    way? Let's examine if the sample size meets the "less than 5% the size of the
                                    population" so
                                    we can use the guideline above. We see that
                                    \[ \dfrac{20}{10000}=0.002=0.2\% \]
                                    Since we see that the sample size is small (20) relative to the population size
                                    (10,000), the 5% guideline allows us to treat these draws as independent. That means
                                    that
                                    when we make a selection, we will be treating this as <b>"with replacement"</b> so that
                                    we
                                    do not have to adjust the probabilities. Thus:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \[
                                    P(\text{all 20 good}) =
                                    \dfrac{9500}{10000}\cdot\dfrac{9500}{10000}\cdot\dfrac{9500}{10000}\cdots\]
                                    \[ \quad \quad =\left(\dfrac{9500}{10000}\right)^{20}.
                                    \]
                                </p>
                                <p>Using technology, this probability is approximately 0.3585.</p>
