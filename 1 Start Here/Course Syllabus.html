                    <h2>Methods of Instruction</h2>
                    <p>The in-class lectures and activities will act as your main source of instruction for this course
                        with maybe an occasional recording outside of class to supplement instruction. You must take an
                        active role in your own instruction to be successful making sure to attend as many classes as
                        possible and using outside resources if needed. For example, you must read the online textbook
                        and use classroom lecture notes to complete homework assignments, and stay up-to-date on
                        homework/quizzes in <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">MyOpenMath</a>. You will be responsible for learning the material and for
                        getting help if you are having difficulties. This is not a self-paces course. You must follow
                        the deadlines set in the calendar. Do not allow yourself to fall behind.</p>

                    <h2>General Education Mathematics Learning Outcomes:</h2>
                    <p>Students will demonstrate the ability to:</p>

                    <h2>Attendance</h2>
                    <p>You are expected by the college to attend class and be on time for class. Entering or leaving a
                        class during class time is inconsiderate to the instructor and other class members. Furthermore,
                        if you have an unexcused absence on a test or quiz day, you will not be allowed to make-up the
                        quiz or test. An absence due to illness or family emergency may be excused, provided that you
                        can supply acceptable written evidence if required. If you have to miss a test/quiz day for any
                        reason, please make plans before to take the test/quiz at a later date.</p>

                    <h2>Inclement Weather</h2>
                    <p>If applicable to this class, in case of inclement weather, please check the <a
                            href="http://columbiastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia State
                            website</a>, your email or call the Columbia State closing line at 931-540-2515. Follow
                        instructions given for late openings and how this may affect class times. Students are
                        individually responsible for decisions regarding travel safety.</p>

                    <h2>Homework</h2>
                    <p>Homework is an important commitment in a mathematics classroom and does effect your attendance
                        grade in this class. Homework is assigned with each lesson and can be accessed by clicking the
                        MyOpen Math section here in Online Campus (<a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">MyOpenMath</a>). Completed <strong>homework will account for 30% of your
                            grade</strong>. Again, homework is to be completed online inside of MyOpenMath. All Homework
                        assignments can be accessed past the due date for a 15% late penalty on any problems you haven't
                        completed so even if it is late, it is still worth completing the homework.</p>

                    <h2>Participation</h2>
                    <p><strong>Weekly Checks:</strong> For this course, participation will be based on a grade taken
                        each Sunday night and will be based on your completion of homework from lectures during the
                        week. For example: "Homework Check 2" will be one marked with "Complete 60% of Chapter 1
                        Homework", and chapter 1 will have been talked about in the previous week meaning you should
                        have plenty of time to get this complete. So while there is no participation points for physical
                        attendance, it is important to attend class so you know what content you need to be working on
                        and to do any in-class quizzes we may have during the week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discussion Board:</strong> At times the instructor may make use of the "discussion" tool
                        in Online Campus. You can find discussion board topics under "Assignments" then "Discussion" on
                        the top navigation bar. The discussion tool is always used for any classes that are
                        <strong>online</strong> or <strong>hybrid</strong>, but may also be utilized for other courses
                        at the instructor's discretion. Make sure to follow class announcements to ensure you aren't
                        missing any discussion board posts.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Projects:</strong> Introductory Statistics courses may assign a project to do during the
                        course of the semester. Make sure to follow class announcements to see if the instructor plans
                        to have a semester statistics project. </p>
                    <p><strong>Weekly Checks, Discussion, and Projects make up 5% of your grade</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Quizzes</h2>
                    <p>There will be several quizzes throughout the semester, generally on a weekly basis. These will be
                        conducted either in-class or in MyOpenMath. Check your online campus to watch for upcoming
                        online quizzes due. <strong>Quizzes count for 10% of your grade.</strong> All Quizzes can be
                        accessed past the due date for a 15% late penalty on any you haven't completed, it is still
                        worth completing the quizzes after the due date.</p>

                    <h2>Exams</h2>
                    <p>During the semester there will be 3 announced tests (one at the end of each unit) and a
                        comprehensive final exam. There are no makeup tests. If you miss a test you can access it past
                        the due date for a 15% late penalty. If there is some reason you do have to miss an exam, please
                        make arrangements <strong>before</strong> the exam happens so you can get an extension.
                        <strong>Each test is 10% of your final grade.</strong> <strong>The final exam is a comprehensive
                            test worth 25% of your final grade.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bonus Points</h2>
                    <p>You can obtain bonus points in the course by doing various activities around campus, the STEM
                        Lecture quizzes located in online campus, or by participating in tutoring. You can obtain a
                        <strong>maximum of 30 points</strong> from all sources. These points can be applied to any of
                        your regular unit tests (test 1, 2 or 3). Bonus points CANNOT be applied to the final exam. You
                        will save your bonus points up till the end of the semester and let me know then which of the 3
                        exams you want your points on. You can split the points you have accumulated in any way you
                        desire.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Columbia State's QEP (Quality Enhancement Plan)</h2>
                    <p>Columbia State Community College has decided to invest in developing students’ <strong>critical
                            thinking skills</strong> as a part of our Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP). According to
                        research, employee survey feedback, and student survey feedback, critical thinking was
                        identified as one of the most important skills college students need in order to succeed. Highly
                        sought after in the current job market, critical thinking is crucial for students who seek
                        employment in their chosen careers after graduation. Critical Thinking is "the ability to
                        analyze and interpret relevant information and apply it to novel situations and problems.”
                        Columbia State has named their QEP initiative <strong>“Thinking Critically, Growing
                            Purposefully.”</strong></p>
