    <h2>What is Introductory Statistics?</h2>
    <p>Introductory Statistics is a foundational course that teaches students how to collect, analyze, and interpret data. It covers essential statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, probability, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics. Students will gain valuable skills that are applicable in a variety of fields such as business, healthcare, education, and social sciences. By the end of the course, students will be able to make data-informed decisions and critically evaluate statistical claims.</p>

    <h2>What is OER (Open Educational Resources)?</h2>
    <p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are free and openly licensed educational materials that are designed to be accessible to everyone. This semester, your Introductory Statistics course will utilize OER materials, eliminating the need for costly textbooks. MyOpenMath will be the primary platform used for delivering assignments, quizzes, and exams. This approach not only saves money but also provides a flexible and interactive learning environment tailored to help you succeed.</p>

    <h2>How can I be successful?</h2>
